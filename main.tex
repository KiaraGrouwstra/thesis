\subsection{Program Synthesis}

\begin{displayquote}
    truly solving program synthesis is the last programming problem mankind will have to solve~\citep{nps}
\end{displayquote}

\begin{displayquote}
    If artificial intelligence (AI) is software 2.0~\citep{software20},
    then \emph{program synthesis} is software 2.0 applied to the field of software development itself.
\end{displayquote}
% I think only few will feel offended by the implication all program synthesis uses AI.

% TODO: talk more about the gaps between 1.0/engineering vs 2.0/AI, and how the present work aims to bridge those.

% synthesis
\emph{Program synthesis}~\citep{church1957applications} is the task to automatically construct a program%
~\footnote{
    While the definition of a program might be debatable as well,
    and there has been work on predicting type signatures from function names~\citep{wang2018predicting},
    for the purpose of our paper we will focus on traditional executable programs,
    rather than e.g. 'programs' describing types.
}%
that satisfies a given high-level specification,
be it a formal specification, a natural language description,
full program \emph{traces}, input-output examples,
or an existing program.~\citep{gulwani2017program}.
% ~\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_synthesis}}

This enables us to distill our modeled function
to a simplified discrete form that may well be intelligible to humans as well,
opening up opportunities for human-machine cooperation in writing software.
Specifically, this will allow machines to improve on programs written by humans, and the other way around.
As such, program synthesis may bring \emph{hybrid intelligence} to the field of software development.

And in fact, we may already see this in the proliferation of intelligent code completion tools%
~\footnote{
    These include Microsoft's \emph{Intellisense},
    Google's \emph{ML Complete},
    Jetbrains's code completion in their IntelliJ IDE,
    as well as Codota's \emph{TabNine}.
},
as well as in a novel development paradigm in functional programming based on typed holes called \emph{type-driven development}~\citep{brady2017type}.

\subsection{Related fields}

To give more context on how program synthesis fits into the bigger picture,
we will briefly compare it to some other fields: program induction, supervised learning, as well as constraint satisfaction and discrete optimization.

\subsubsection{Program Induction}

Unfortunately the field suffers from competing definitions, blurring the distinction between what constitutes program \emph{synthesis} versus what constitutes program \emph{induction}. In short though, those in either field claim to be more general than the other branch.

The field of \emph{inductive programming}~\citep{popplestone1969experiment,plotkin1970note,fogel1966intelligent}, primarily known for its sub-branch of \emph{inductive logic programming}~\citep{muggleton1991inductive} focused on propositional logic, is simply the use of inductive logic for the purpose of automatic synthesis of programs, and was coined to distinguish itself from the \emph{deductive} techniques used in \citet{church1957applications}'s synthesis of circuits. Under this definition, the term program synthesis is used to refer to its original scope of program generation using deductive techniques.

To explain, whereas in the original problem definition the desired behavior was fully specified, program \emph{induction} aimed to generalize the problem to also tackle automatic generation of programs for which the desired behavior had only partially been made explicit.

Under this definition, there is no significant distinction between our present work and program induction's sub-branch of \emph{inductive functional programming}, focused on the generation of programs in functional programming languages such as Lisp~\citep{lisp} or Haskell.

Nevertheless, in current parlance \emph{program synthesis} is often used in a broader scope, extending from the original deductive approach to include inductive approaches as well. In this view, the two fields are distinguished in that program \emph{synthesis} is defined as to explicitly return a program, whereas program \emph{induction} learns to \emph{mimic} it rather than explicitly return it.~\citep{devlin2017robustfill,gulwani2017program,nps}
While this appears to clash with the latter term as used in the field of inductive \emph{functional} programming, this view likely stems from widespread use of the term in the field of inductive \emph{logic} programming.

This terminology itself is not of much concern for our present paper, as the boundaries between the fields have often been muddy.
Moreover, recent applications of AI to this field have led to the more recent term of \emph{neural program synthesis}~\citep{nps}. Therefore, we will simply settle for using 'program synthesis' to the field in general as well.

\subsubsection{Supervised Learning}

The above definition of program synthesis as explicitly returning a program,
% particularly in its \emph{programming by example} (PBE) variant of learning from input-output examples,
is helpful to explain how it differs from \emph{supervised learning},
the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs~\citep{russell2002artificial}.

Neural learning methods may be applied to any branch of program synthesis,
and several of these may in fact be tackled using setups involving supervised learning.
Of particular note here however is a branch referred to as \emph{programming by example} (PBE),
like supervised learning based on modeling the logic of given input-output pairs.

What sets these apart is that PBE fits a model into the discrete form of a given grammar to produce a program,
forcing one to instantiate such a model from probabilistic data interpretations,
whereas in supervised learning,
such probabilistic interpretations of the data may be taken at prediction time.

This also explains the relative benefits of these two fields.

Whereas supervised learning may stay in the continuous realm,
characterized by differentiable models optimizable by backpropagation~\citep{backproprnn},
and not limited in expressivity by the limitations of any particular grammar or set of operations.
This makes it well-positioned to solve problems deemed too complex for traditional programming, such as image recognition.

PBE may instead construct a traditional program,
which may be deterministic, generalize better~\citep{nps}, be provably correct~\citep{nps}, as well as potentially faster to execute than predictions using the original machine learning model.
Moreover, using programs as a common denominator between human and machine-based programmers makes for human-intelligible machine-made models,
relevant in the field of \emph{interpretable} or \emph{explainable artificial intelligence}
~\footnote{
    One may note that if the goal in using program synthesis is to make models more interpretable,
    one could potentially start out by training a neural model, then approximate this by synthesizing a program similar to it. And in fact, \citet{pirl} apply exactly this approach for reinforcement learning.
},
while also enabling human-machine cooperation in the production and maintenance of software.

Furthermore, program synthesis may help tackle the problem in AI of \emph{composability}:
programs in their essence \emph{compose} operations into larger logical building blocks,
to be reused or further generalized.
In supervised learning, on the other hand,
one would traditionally need to retrain their model in the event a new predictor class is added,
which depending on the model complexity may be quite costly.
This challenge of composabability in AI has also been studied by the field of \emph{hierarchical reinforcement learning}~\citep{hierarchicalrl}.

In program synthesis, one may take an existing program, and synthesize variants intended to generalize the existing logic to match the new data.~\citep{myth}
This makes program synthesis well-suited to facilitate the automation of programming.
~\footnote{
    One may note that this would technically enable the synthesis of programs implementing machine learning models as well.
    However, such an approach would make for a relatively expensive evaluation function,
    and as such is traditionally delegated to the field of \emph{neural architecture search}.
}

In other words, whereas supervised learning makes for simpler learning,
program synthesis may make for programs that are more efficient, composable,
and providing better interaction with humans in terms of being understandable and incorporating knowledge of human experts.
% TODO: citation needed?
% table of relative merits: supervised learning side, pros: able to model ill-defined logic, more suited for stochastic predictions

\subsubsection{Constraint satisfaction vs. discrete optimization}

% relation to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming : that seems a subset associated with logic programming
% relation to SMT: that's first-order logic, synthesis is second-order
% relation to SAT: that's SMT without linear constraints, so even less expressive
While its definition may appear to frame program synthesis as a type of \emph{constraint satisfaction} problem (CSP),
where a program either does or does not satisfy the given specification,
% ~\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem}
one could also opt to approach it as a \emph{discrete optimization} problem,
% relation to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization : that one assumes a finite set of objects? 
as specifications such as input-output examples allow us to count the examples our candidate program satisfies.

Intuitively, a program satisfying part of our examples may be regarded as closer to a solution than one that does not satisfy as many.
Furthermore, additional considerations such as performance may further push us to find a solution that not only calculates outputs correctly but also runs within reasonable time or memory constraints.
These then provide a quantifiable feedback measure for us to optimize.

However, constraint satisfaction and discrete optimization were intended to solve fully specified problems (\emph{deduction}),
while in modern-day program synthesis, as we will explain later,
we usually need to settle for a \emph{partial} specification of the intended program's behavior (\emph{induction}).

As such, applying such techniques to the field of program synthesis using partial specifications may lead us to the problem of \emph{overfitting}:
while found solutions might well satisfy the \emph{specified} behavior,
the question would be whether these would also \emph{generalize} to match our \emph{intended} behavior,
as is the goal in program synthesis.

\subsection{Types of program synthesis} \label{sec:synthtypes}

While the common thread in program synthesis is that our intended output takes the form of a program,
sub-branches of this field are primarily defined by the types of input we use to come to this output.
Here we will give a brief overview of such variants of program synthesis.

% \subsubsection{Synthesis from formal specifications}

Program synthesis was traditionally studied as a computer science problem,
where the problem was typically framed using a \emph{formal specification}.
This problem was then tackled using e.g. an enumerative search, deductive methods, or constraint-solving techniques.~\citep{gulwani2017program}
However, such formal specifications ended up about as hard to write as the original program,
rendering this approach to the problem not very useful.

Closely related to this field is the idea to synthesize a program solely from its \emph{type signature}.
Traditionally types would make for \emph{inductive} synthesis,
i.e. only making for an \emph{incomplete} program specification,
% using types of a level that users may be more familiar with,
% which may include polymorphic types or even algebraic data types,
but this may end up not sufficiently expressive:
while certainly constraining the program space,
input/output examples may still be needed to disambiguate between potential candidate programs.
Adding such examples brings us to the branch of \emph{type-theoretic programming by example},
which we will introduce in further detail in section \ref{sec:typepbe}.

There have also been attempts to get such a type-based approach closer to \emph{deductive} synthesis,
i.e. making for a \emph{complete} behavioral program specification,
through the use of e.g. refinement types~\citep{synquid} or succinct types~\citep{guospeeding}.
However, these approaches tend to fall into a similar pitfall as synthesis from \emph{formal specifications},
requiring the user to write such a detailed type specification that they might have as well just written the program directly.%
~\footnote{
    However, perhaps one might instead also be able to synthesize this detailed type specification,
    giving the benefit of additional formal guarantees from our actual program that we could then synthesize from this type specification!
}

% \subsubsection{Synthesis from natural-language descriptions}

Synthesis from \emph{natural-language} descriptions%
~\citep{neuralprogrammer,zhong2017seq2sql},
which might also involve \emph{speech recognition}%
~\citep{juang1991hidden,graves2013speech},
like PBE
% is an example of \emph{inductive} synthesis:
% as we are no longer tied to a formal specification,
lacks a formal specification,
as the language used is not necessarily constrained.
As such, this ends up as a supervised learning problem:
we take sample natural language inputs,
and try to learn their corresponding resulting programs.

This area is closely connected to the field of
\emph{personal virtual assistants}~\citep{virtualassistant,genie},
where response actions may be regarded as constrained synthesized programs,
although these might also feature unconstrained \emph{dialogue}~\citep{li2016deep} responses,
as well as \emph{goal-oriented} or \emph{task-oriented dialogue}~\citep{bordes2016goaldialogue,li2016taskdialogue}.
This task has also been combined with \emph{programming from examples}.~\citep{polosukhin2018neural}

% \subsubsection{Program repair}

\emph{Program repair} is a synthesis task where the input to the synthesizer is a (broken) program that is to be fixed by making changes to the program.~\citep{demsky2006inference,kaleeswaran2014minthint}
This can be used in e.g. IDEs, to suggest users how they might potentially fix syntax errors or misspelled variables in their code.

As the input to this synthesis branch consists of existing programs,
it also has quite some overlap with \emph{static code analysis}~\citep{louridas2006static,brockschmidt2018generative},
which is about gaining insights into snippets of source code,
and as such may help provide features relevant for use in program repair.

% \subsubsection{Source-to-source translation} \label{sec:source2source}

Similar to program repair, \emph{source-to-source translation}%
~\citep{loveman1977program,albrecht1980source,partsch1983program,waters1988program,visser2005survey,czarnecki2006feature,chen2018tree}
is a branch of synthesis where both the input and output are a program.
However, rather than fixing an existing program,
the task here is to learn a specific \emph{translation} task,
e.g. from one programming language to another.
Over recent years, this field has become an area of application for \emph{neural machine translation}.%
~\citep{cho2014nmt,kim2019translating}

% \subsubsection{Programming by Example (PBE)}

Instead, it was found that for users, input-output examples were a more attractive way to specify desired program behavior,
although as an incomplete specification this made for a harder problem from the perspective of the synthesizer.~\citep{bodik2013algorithmic}
This field is named \emph{programming by example} (PBE).

As the specification is incomplete here, PBE is considered \emph{inductive} synthesis, as opposed to the \emph{deductive} synthesis where we do have a complete specification.
In other words, from the perspective of the synthesizer, PBE is generally a more difficult problem.

PBE may be further split up according to the type of program to be synthesized~\citep{bodik2013algorithmic},
generating \emph{logic programs} (assigning truth values to variables),
or generating \emph{functional programs} (e.g. Lisp, Haskell).
PBE too has branches based on deductive techniques (including \emph{type-theoretic} PBE),
inspired by synthesis from formal specifications.
% Note that these categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive:
% a synthesizer might for example have a natural language input,
% while using this to say generate a functional program.
% Either way,
Our work will focus on PBE in the category of functional programs,
where the goal is to automate traditional programming tasks.

% \subsubsection{Synthesis from traces}

Synthesis from program \emph{traces}~\citep{koskimies1994automatic},
and the related synthesis from \emph{Linear Temporal Logic} (LTL)
specifications~\citep{camacho2019towards}, are about
a system reacting to sequences of inputs to mimic the desired program behavior.
These are useful for e.g. specifying the expected behavior of user interfaces.
Essentially this task may be viewed as a generalized version of PBE,
adding the additional challenge of figuring out which inputs triggered which state changes.

% \subsubsection{Neural program synthesis}

Over recent years, synthesis problems have been explored using \emph{machine learning} approaches,
under the name of \emph{neural program synthesis} (NPS)~\citep{nps}.
This area is about learning to solve a class of synthesis problems given data.
Note that this is a synthesis \emph{technique}, whereas the the above categories are synthesis \emph{problem types}.

Whereas traditional approaches in program synthesis (and particularly PBE) focused on constraining the large discrete search space,
such as deductive and constraint-solving approaches,
\emph{neural} program synthesis instead tends break down the problem by incrementally generating programs,
using continuous representations of the state space to predict the next token.
% be it in a sequential fashion~\citep{npi,neuralmachinetranslation,alphanpi},
% or in a structured one based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs)~\citep{nsps}.

\subsection{Challenges}

\subsubsection{Challenges of program synthesis}
% \subsubsection{Challenges of programming by example}

While considered a holy grail of computer science~\citep{gulwani2017program},
program synthesis in general is a challenging task, characterized by large search spaces,
e.g. a space of $10^{5943}$ programs discovering an expert implementation of the MD5 hash function.~\cite{gulwani2017program}

\subsubsection{Challenges of type-theoretic programming by example} \label{sec:typepbe}

One issue with type-theoretic approaches to PBE, later introduced in further detail,
is that while such search methods are able to make use of both input/output examples and types in their search,
there is no sense of learning across problem instances to further reduce synthesis time.

\subsubsection{Challenges of neural programming by example} \label{sec:challengesnps}

While the typically incremental approach of neural program synthesis breaks down the problem of PBE by considering one part of the program at a time, the original challenge remains:
our search space typically remains large, meaning it will not be viable to proportionally scale our training sets by program size.

Whereas a program synthesizer may be programmed or taught to output programs adhering to a given grammar,
we may generally only be able to evaluate the quality of \emph{complete} programs:
there is typically no guarantee that \emph{partial} constructions of the full program would \emph{also} qualify as a full executable program adherent to the grammar.
As a result, neural synthesizers will have little intermediary feedback to go by, limiting their effectiveness.

But if only \emph{complete} programs can be evaluated for validity and behavior, then 
we will be ill-equipped to provide synthesizers with an accurate understanding of partial programs,
which make up for a large part of our prediction steps.
As such, it would be desirable to somehow supervise the intermediate prediction steps.
This echoes \citet{nps}'s conclusion that one area of research in neural program synthesis that requires further exploration is
\emph{specifically designing neural architectures} to excel at the difficult problems of program synthesis.

% \paragraph{Challenges of sequential-based neural programming by example}

Most neural synthesis techniques, particular those using a \emph{sequence-to-sequence} approach%
~\footnote{
    While in tree-based synthesis techniques it might not be possible to \emph{execute} programs either,
    this should at least result in an (incomplete) AST,
    which should be significantly easier to learn to embed given the knowledge of how to embed a complete AST than a program that does not even parse.
    % TODO: confirm if there is a distinction between tree-based / node-based
},
additionally face the issue of dissonance between their representation of complete programs and that of intermediate states.
As such intermediate states do not in general constitute valid programs,
these neural synthesizers have an additional task to solve:
compensating for their lack of an inherently meaningful incremental state.

\subsection{Research question}

\subsubsection{Complementary strengths}

Our key observation here is thus that input-output examples and types are quite complementary as specifications constraining our program behavior:
whereas input-output examples are relatively expressive, they may only help us to evaluate the quality of complete programs;
types, on the other hand, are by themselves not usually descriptive enough of our task,
but may help us to evaluate and inform further incremental synthesis steps even of incomplete functions still containing holes.

\subsubsection{Hypotheses}

We therefore hypothesize that program synthesizers may thus capitalize on this synergy by utilizing both types of information,
rather than settling for only one of the two, as most existing methods have done.%
~\footnote{
    While one might wonder if this constrains our idea to the subset of PBE problems where type information is available,
    this limitation is essentially meaningless: when one has input-output examples, one should generally be able to infer their type.
    This would render our idea applicable for practically any (neural) methods for PBE.
}%
~\footnote{
    Whereas one might wonder if a focus on types may constrain our method to synthesizing statically typed languages,
    in the functional paradigm in particular, we believe there are workarounds to this.
    While we certainly believe users may find switching to a statically typed functional language to be beneficial~\citep{hughes1989functional},
    an alternative would be to (1) have one algorithm translate the partial program to a statically typed language,
    (2) complete the program using program synthesis from there,
    then finally, (3) using a third algorithm, translate the full program back to the target language.
}

Specifically, we hypothesize that the effectiveness of neural program synthesis may be improved by
adding type information as additional features during training and testing,
which in AST-based neural program synthesis may help supervise each incremental prediction step.

\begin{displayquote} % \label{hyp:types}
    \emph{Research question \#1: can neural program synthesis methods benefit from using types as additional features?}
\end{displayquote}

An alternative approach would be to enumerate any possible options for a given node,
then filtering this list of options based on such compiler feedback.%
~\footnote{One potential concern here is the scalability of such enumeration as the number of valid options grows.}

This is indeed done for type-based program synthesis~\citep{myth},
and we hypothesize neural synthesis approaches may benefit from such pre-filtering as well,
reducing synthesis to a ranking problem of (partial) candidate programs.

\begin{displayquote} \label{hyp:filter}
    \emph{Research question \#2: can neural program synthesis methods benefit from type-based filters by reframing the problem to learning-to-rank?}
\end{displayquote}

\section{Expected Contribution} % \label{sec:expected-contribution}

The present work aims to be the first experiment to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item bring the \emph{type-based information} traditionally used in program synthesis into the newer branch of neural program synthesis;
    \item \emph{bridge} the two fields, such as to find a best-of-both-worlds golden mean;
    \item use this type info to better \emph{constrain the search space}, improving the effectiveness of (neural) program synthesis methods;
    \item show that the synthesis of statically typeable programs may benefit from techniques \emph{specific} to this domain, and therefore for the purpose of automatic programming merits further study in itself;
    \item offer an \emph{open-source implementation} of the algorithm described in \citet{nsps};
    \item generate a \emph{dataset} for neural synthesis of functional programs;
    \item lay out a way of \emph{generating} such datasets, including an open-source implementation, addressing the current reliance on hand-crafted curricula~\citep{nps};
    % provide an implementation that may be one of the first machine learning projects utilizing
    \item showcase \emph{static tensor typing} as offered by the \emph{HaskTorch} deep learning library~\citep{hasktorch}.
\end{itemize}

% \pagebreak

\section{Existing approaches to programming by example}

PBE has traditionally known heuristics such as
\emph{Version Space Algebras} (VSAs)~\citep{mitchell1982generalization},
which aim to constrain grammar productions by using
\emph{candidate elimination} to keep track of a \emph{hypothesis space}.

Another useful tool is \emph{ambiguity resolution},
i.e. requesting user input to resolve ambiguity
in the event that multiple candidate programs
fulfill the given input-output example pairs.%
~\citep{gulwani2017program}
While we will come back to ambiguity resolution as it is
alleviated by \emph{active learning},
these two techniques are primarily used to complement
other methods we will introduce here now.

Please do note that program synthesis has been somewhat different
from other branches of machine learning, such as image recognition:
unfortunately the field has been so diverse that there has been little
standardization of benchmarking tasks to compare approaches like
\emph{ImageNet}~\citep{deng2009imagenet} had done for computer vision tasks.
While this means we will not present statistics
comparing the performance of these various approaches,
we will instead lay out their conceptual differences and weaknesses.

\subsection{Search-based programming by example}

Under search-based methods for programming by example we will classify any approaches that do not evolve \emph{learning} to synthesize by means of a neural component.

While the approaches in this category range from naive to sophisticated,
they unfortunately share a common drawback:
whereas neural synthesizers allow one to tweak a \emph{loss function} to take into account various sub-goals,
non-neural synthesizers have no sense of \emph{learning}
from existing programs or across problem instances,
meaning they will have trouble achieving:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{generalizability}~\citep{nps};
    \item \emph{interpretability} to humans (human \emph{source code bias})~\citep{nps};
    \item \emph{synthesized program performance}~\citep{schkufza2016stochastic};
    \item an increase in \emph{synthesizer performance},
    as they must solve any new synthesis task essentially from scratch,
    and could never have as much information to this end as a neural synthesizer,
    which may in fact be able to use arbitrary learned features~\citep{odena2020learning}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Enumerative search}

The naive approach to synthesis would be to enumerate all the possible programs in our search space,
and for each one evaluate whether it satisfies our task specification.
This is called \emph{enumerative} or \emph{depth-first search} (DFS).
As one might expect, such an approach does not generalize \emph{scale} well with search space size however.

\subsubsection{Evolutionary algorithms}

\emph{Evolutionary algorithms}~\citep{eiben2003introduction} are a black-box optimization method of potentially discrete functions.

\emph{Genetic programming} is a branch of evolutionary algorithms based on \emph{tree} representations,
rendering it viable to \emph{evolve} programs using some AST representation.~\citep{koza1994genetic}
Such \emph{evolution} is a search method that consists of generating programs similar to existing promising candidates, using either \emph{mutations} or \emph{combinations} of existing candidate solutions.

However, while such heuristics help improve on the baseline of enumerative search,
unfortunately such optimization is still a one-shot exercise:
it has little notion of \emph{learning} from previous problems to improve performance on future similar problems.%
~\footnote{
    Technically one way to let an evolutionary algorithm \emph{learn} would be to seed runs on new problems using solutions from previous similar problems.
    However, such choices would be left up to the user,
    and are not something that the evolutionary algorithm itself is able to help out on.
    In practice, even under the same class of problems,
    different problem instances will likely require different end solutions,
    largely rendering this hack moot.
}
As such, evolutionary approaches have been more popular in areas where their strategy of \emph{local search} would pose an advantage, such as for \emph{super-optimization}~\citep{schkufza2016stochastic} (optimizing the performance of an existing program) and \emph{program repair}~\citep{weimer2009automatically,forrest2009genetic}.

\subsubsection{Active learning and Bayesian optimization}

\emph{Active learning}~\citep{settles2009active} and
\emph{Bayesian optimization}~\citep{mockus2012bayesian}
are two techniques intended to minimize a required number of
expensive evaluation rounds in modeling discrete functions.
Their difference however lies in their intended objective:
the objective in \emph{active learning} is to most accurately
model the underlying function, while in
\emph{Bayesian optimization} the objective is to maximize
a given reward (as a total over the number of evaluations),
which renders it a trade-off of \emph{exploration} versus
\emph{exploitation} similar to that of reinforcement learning.

Within program synthesis, active learning is primarily used to
facilitate effectively requesting interactive user feedback when
trying to synthesize a particular function in PBE when faced
with ambiguity of user intent.~\citep{shen2019using}%
~\footnote{
    Interactive user feedback is a useful technique in the face of ambiguity,
    but for the purpose of this paper we will not focus on this technique.
}

Unlike evolutionary algorithms, these techniques model the underlying function,
allowing one to generalize to other problem instances as well.
As a result, we can use these not only in interactive feedback,
but also to directly decide which programs we wish to evaluate programmatically.
However, programmatic evaluations are typically cheap,
making this use-case less of a fit given the premise of these techniques.

While Bayesian optimization has been used to this end~\citep{looks2005learning},
the problem with using it this way is that the cost complexity of this technique
scales terribly to larger search spaces, which are common in program synthesis.
The risk with this is that this may make it much faster to just evaluate
multiple programs in the search space than it would be to spend those CPU cycles
figuring out which single evaluation might be most promising or informative.
As such, subsequent attempts have limited its use to constrained
sub-problems like \emph{sketch filling}.~\citep{verma2018programmatically}

\subsubsection{Oracle-guided synthesis}

One attempt to overcome the computational complexity of program synthesis
has been \emph{oracle-guided synthesis}~\citep{solar2008program},
which splits the synthesis task into generating and filling of program
\emph{sketches}~\citep{murali2017neural}.
Unlike full synthesis itself, sketch filling is not a second-order but a
first-order logic problem, enabling the use of constraint-solving methods
such as satisfiability (SAT) or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers%
~\citep{akiba2013calibrating,alur2013syntax,alur2016sygus,rosette,architecture}%
~\footnote{
    SMT solvers combine SAT-style search with theories like arithmetic and inequalities.
} for the filling of sketches, potentially further extended with
\emph{conflict-driven learning}~\citep{feng2018program,hornclauses},
which help \emph{backtrack} if the branch explored turns out unviable.
The point here is that if a given sketch has multiple holes,
once a filled version turns out unviable due to a certain production rules used for one of its holes,
other variants involving the faulty choice in question may be ruled out as well.

This synthesis method has also spawned a solver-aided language
\emph{designed} to facilitate this type of program synthesis~\citep{rosette},
which generates satisfiability conditions for satisfactory programs
based on failing input-output examples such as to synthesize program repairs.

However, like evolutionary algorithms, this is a one-shot technique
that does not learn across problem instances.
As such, it is likely not as efficient if our goal is to create a general synthesizer,
although it could still be incorporated into \emph{hybrid} approaches~\citep{deepcoder} that \emph{would} use learned knowledge to improve on a search using constraint-solving methods.

\subsubsection{Deductive techniques}

\emph{Deductive} search techniques for PBE were inspired by such
techniques used in synthesis from formal specifications,
but have been applied to the \emph{inductive} task of PBE as well.
Deductive techniques are based on theorem provers,
and recursively reduce the synthesis problem into sub-problems,
propagating constraints.
These include approaches based on \emph{inverse semantics} of
DSL operators and \emph{type-theoretic PBE}.

% \paragraph{Inverse semantics}

The idea of \emph{inverse semantics} is to reduce the complexity
of the synthesis task by using inverse logic.~\citep{flashmeta,prose}
This is a top-down search where we would take a grammatical
production rule, presume it to be our outer expression,
and use its inverse logic to propagate our original
input-output examples to its sub-expressions.
This way we have obtained a simpler sub-problem to solve.

The generalization of such a function inverse to work with functions
taking multiple parameters using \emph{witness functions},
each representing a function inverse for a given parameter.

While these are a useful search technique however, their
use is unfortunately limited to invertible operations,
rendering this a helpful complement to, yet not a
reliable alternative to other PBE methods.%
~\footnote{
    A recent potential workaround not reliant on invertability
    has been the approach by \citet{odena2020learning},
    who would, given properties of a function composition
    $f \circ g$ and of $f$, use machine learning to predict
    the properties of $g$.
    However, it is not immediately clear if this technique
    has a straight-forward equivalent in the domain of
    input-output examples.
}

% \paragraph{Type-theoretic programming by example}

\emph{Type-theoretic} deductive search is about the use of programming
types to constrain the synthesis search space.
While there have been pure type-based approaches based on e.g.
refinement types~\citep{synquid} or succinct types~\citep{guospeeding},
which can be used as a powerful way of specifying program behavior,
unfortunately these typically end up in a similar pitfall as
synthesis from formal specifications;
they often require the user to essentially write a specification
that may end up similar in complexity to the actual program itself,
in a sense potentially defeating the point of using a synthesizer.

% As such, as with synthesis from formal specifications itself,
% it may be more realistic to use type-based logic from
% the type information we do have readily available,
% using this to complement other synthesis methods,
% rather than presume we may fully rely on just type-theoretic PBE.

However, this branch is nevertheless useful in combination with other methods,
and the use of type-theoretic deductive search has been combined with PBE by \citet{myth}.
While this direction seems quite promising,
it unfortunately suffers from similar issues as other non-neural search methods:
while it may work as a one-shot technique,
there is no sense of learning across multiple problem instances.
% TODO: confirm if true. this presumes there is stuff to learn that these proof-theoretic techniques didn't have hard-coded already. do they really *know* *everything* in terms of function behavior patterns that could be learned tho?

\subsection{Neural program synthesis}

More recently, PBE has been explored using machine learning approaches, under the name of \emph{neural program synthesis} (NPS)~\citep{nps}.
Whereas traditional approaches in program synthesis (and particularly PBE) focused on constraining the large discrete search space,
such as deductive and constraint-solving approaches,
\emph{neural} program synthesis instead tends to incrementally generate programs,
using continuous representations of the state space to predict the next token,
be it in a sequential fashion~\citep{npi,neuralmachinetranslation,alphanpi},
or in a structured one based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs)~\citep{nsps}.

Unfortunately though, program synthesis in its general sense has been less straight-forward to tackle by neural methods than other AI problems,
as our search space is typically discrete, meaning we cannot simply apply gradient-based optimization such as \emph{stochastic gradient descent} (SGD).~\citep{nps}

This issue can be worked around in different ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using a \emph{differentiable interpreter} to directly enable gradient-based optimization.~\citep{forth,terpret,houdini,feser2016differentiable,rocktaschel2017end,abadi2019simple}
        However, although unfortunately only empirical evidence is available to compare this approach, as per \citet{terpret} such purely SGD-based methods so far appear to have proven less effective than traditional or mixed methods.
    \item Using \emph{strong supervision}, i.e. create a differentiable loss signal
        to supervise synthesis training by checking if the synthesized program is \emph{identical} to the target program,
        rather than if it has \emph{equivalent behavior}.
        This approach unfortunately simplifies our problem \emph{too much}%
        ~\footnote{
            In reality, we wish to condition our model to synthesize not just the known programs,
            but to generalize to learn to synthesize \emph{unknown} programs matching our task specification as well.
            Supervising by a given 'known correct' program instead tells our model that other programs matching our specification somehow do not qualify as correct.
            As a result, such supervision requires that the training dataset provides a representative sample of our full program space:
            training on the full program search space ensures that such bias from individual samples should be approximately averaged out.
            This assumption is broken however for datasets much smaller than the program space,
            meaning that this approach does not scale well to bigger search spaces.
            % TODO: add references?
        }, but does make for a relatively simple setup.
    \item Using \emph{weak supervision}~\citep{mapo},
        which tends to address the problem of reward differentiability by using \emph{reinforcement learning} techniques to estimate a gradient to optimize by%
        ~\citep{chen2017towards,bunel2018leveraging,xu2019neural,camacho2019towards},
        so as to learn to synthesize by \emph{trying} based on program performance rather than from direct supervision signals.
        This approach requires a more complex setup, but solves the issues of supervised neural synthesis.
    \item using neural methods in a \emph{hybrid} setup. This approach is explored further in section \ref{sec:ngs}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Graph-based neural program synthesis}

One neural network type used in NPS has been
\emph{graph neural networks}~\citep{shuman2013emerging,wu2020comprehensive}.
These have been used for representing programs~\citep{allamanis2017learning}
as well as for generative modeling of source code~\citep{brockschmidt2018generative}%
to better capture e.g. the relations between variable occurrences,
which \citet{brockschmidt2018generative} suggested would be of use in areas such as \emph{code repair},
where the input to the synthesizer is a (broken) program that is to be fixed.

Such methods could also reasonably be extended to facilitate training of embeddings for neural synthesizer using \emph{transfer learning}~\citep{pan2009survey} or \emph{multi-task learning}~\citep{multitasklearning} setups.
However, while these appear to be a potentially useful complement to other techniques
in the role of program encoder~\footnote{
    One caveat here is that graph neural networks' use in capturing
    variable relationships is only useful if one is synthesizing new variables,
    which in our present \emph{point-free} DSL will remain out of scope,
    as we will explain in further detail later.
}, these appear not to have been designed with PBE in mind specifically.

\subsubsection{Information retrieval methods in neural program synthesis}

A different approach has been to apply techniques from the field of
\emph{information retrieval} (IR) such as \emph{learning-to-rank} (LTR) methods%
~\citep{singh2015predicting}, which aims to learn to judge the
relative quality of programs to rank a satisfactory program candidate on top,
rather than learning to assign scores for each individual program candidate.

However, this method was primarily intended for automated ambiguity resolution;
as one might notice,
it has a cost complexity linear to the number of candidates evaluated,
rendering it essentially the ambiguity resolution equivalent of enumerative search.

As such, this method is useful as a tiebreaker complementing existing methods,
as a potential alternative to other neural models within a top-down search,
or as the neural component in the \emph{neural-guided search} methods discussed below.%
~\footnote{Technically LTR could perform PBE by itself, but this would not scale well.}
While the insight of this approach in itself is valid,
it leaves unanswered questions regarding e.g. feature selection.

\subsubsection{Sequence-based neural program synthesis} % \label{sec:seqnps}

Neural synthesis methods typically employ \emph{sequence-to-sequence}
(or simply \emph{seq2seq}) techniques~\citep{npi,neuralmachinetranslation,alphanpi},
such as the \emph{recurrent neural network} (RNN)~\citep{backproprnn}
and \emph{long short-term memory} (LSTM)~\citep{lstm},
leveraging techniques commonly used in \emph{natural language processing} (NLP)
to represent program synthesis as a sequence prediction problem.%
~\footnote{
    Although many might be most familiar with \emph{seq2seq} methods for their prevalence in NLP,
    the original experiment for the RNN however did in fact test it
    on an inductive logic programming task!~\citep{backproprnn}
}

Such sequential neural synthesizers have been extended with mechanisms such as
convolutional recurrence~\citep{neuralgpu},
attention~\citep{nmt,ptrnets,structuredattention},
memory~\citep{ntm,neuralram,neuralprogrammer,hierarchicalmemory},
function hierarchies~\citep{npi,npl},
and recursion~\citep{cai2017making}.

However, while a hypothetical synthesizer only producing compilable programs would always have direct feedback to its program embeddings,
this feedback signal is much delayed if a synthesizer would gradually synthesize a program e.g. one character at a time,
only learning about resulting program behavior once the program is complete.

As such, sequence-based neural techniques must learn quite a lot:
\emph{in addition to} (continuous logical equivalents of) the traditional compiler tasks of \emph{lexing} input into token categories,
\emph{parsing} these token sequences into hierarchical structures (ASTs),
and interpreting these to \emph{execute} them as programs,
these synthesizers must additionally learn how to construct and update a (memorized) state so as to ultimately,
when the synthesizer considers its code complete, obtain a correct program.

In addition, for our purposes, in sequence-based neural synthesis techniques,
any given intermediate prediction does \emph{not} necessarily \emph{itself} qualify as a program in the grammar,
meaning we are not able to apply a type-based analysis to gain further info for use in further synthesis steps.

\subsubsection{Tree-based neural program synthesis}

Since then, there have also been approaches framing program synthesis by representing programs as \emph{abstract syntax trees} (ASTs) rather than as sequences~\citep{polosukhin2018neural},
allowing such methods to use \emph{tree-structured networks}%
%  such as \emph{recursive} neural networks
.
Of particular interest to us in this category has been the work of \citet{nsps},
which we will introduce in more detail in section \ref{sec:nsps}.

\subsubsection{Neuro-symbolic program synthesis} \label{sec:nsps}

The \emph{neuro-symbolic} program synthesis (NSPS) method introduced in \citet{nsps} improves on existing \emph{sequence-to-sequence}-based neural synthesis models by using a tree-based neural architecture they call the \emph{recursive-reverse-recursive neural network} (R3NN).
This aims to make predictions on credible rule expansions to fill holes%
~\footnote{Note that in the parlance used in \citet{nsps}, \emph{holes} are also referred to as \emph{non-terminal leaf nodes}.}
in \emph{partial program trees} (\emph{PPTs}, basically ASTs containing holes) based on the program's content and structure,
while additionally conditioning on the input/output examples, as seen in figure \ref{nsps}.
The workings of the R3NN are illustrated in figure \ref{r3nn}.

It first makes a \emph{recursive pass} from the leaves through \emph{multi-layer perceptron}s (MLPs)~\citep{rosenblatt1961principles} at each branch,
all the way to the root node of the partial program, making for an embedding of the full program so far;
then a \emph{reverse recursive pass} from this root, again through MLPs, back to the leaves,
which now have their individual embeddings instilled with structural information about the entire program and how they fit into this larger structure.

To condition the partial program tree embedding on the input-output examples,
they try out different example encoders, starting out with a simple LSTM baseline but progressing through various versions of a \emph{cross-correlation encoder},
sliding the output and input feature blocks over one another to calculate their \emph{cross-correlation}~\citep{bracewell1986fourier},
then aggregating these by sum or concatenation,
% using LSTMs instead of dot products then summing,
then using two more involved approaches using LSTMs.

Of these, they found their aggregation by concatenation to only perform on par with their LSTM baseline (both 88\% accuracy on their test dataset) while the sum aggregation performed more poorly (65\%),
whereas their further additions only made for minor improvements on this (91\% each).
% TODO: stop being hand-wavy about the last encoder, I need to try and understand this better.
They additionally empirically test out different times at which to incorporate the input-output conditioning,
and found pre-conditioning (adding them before the recursive pass) to work best.

For the training phase they use the simple setup of supervising by the task function,
while for the test phase they sample 100 programs from their trained model,
considering the task function to have passed if any of these demonstrate the correct behavior on input/output.

\end{figure*}

Some critiques of this model have included it being harder to \emph{batch} for larger programs due to its tree-based architectures,
as well as its pooling at the I/O encoding level being harder to reconcile with \emph{attention} than models using \emph{late pooling}.~\citep{devlin2017robustfill}

For our purposes, by merit of the Microsoft Excel \emph{FlashFill}~\citep{prose} domain this model was tested on,
it also shares a weakness with other neural synthesis models:
as these have usually been applied to \emph{untyped} domains,
they have not been augmented to use information on \emph{types},
while existing \emph{type-theoretic} synthesis approaches have shown this info to be highly valuable.

\subsubsection{Neural-guided search} \label{sec:ngs}

\emph{Neural-guided search} is an approach to \emph{hybrid} neural synthesis,
combining symbolic and statistical synthesis methods.~\citep{nps}
It employs neural components to indicate order within traditional search methods
such as enumerative search (possibly pruned using deduction),
'sort-and-add' enumeration or sketch filling.~\citep{deepcoder}

\citet{kalyan2018neural} built on this to extend the guidance to each search step,
integrating \emph{deductive} search (e.g. a SAT/SMT solver, extensions
like \emph{conflict-driven} learning~\citep{feng2018program}),
a \emph{statistical model} judging generalization,
and a controller deciding which of the model's suggested branches
to explore (branch-and-bound~\citep{kalyan2018neural}, beam search%
~\citep{polosukhin2018neural}, $A^{*}$~\citep{lee2018accelerating}).
The statistical model mentioned here is where other
neural synthesis methods would fit into this approach.
Also of importance here is deciding when to \emph{prune} branches,
although near the leaves this check may be slower
than to just explore any that remain.~\citep{polozov}

\citet{feng2018program} expanded on deductive techniques
like SMT solvers by \emph{conflict-driven} learning,
ensuring that if e.g. a \emph{map} operation would yield an
output list length not corresponding to the desired length,
other operations suffering from the same issue such as
\emph{reverse} and \emph{sort} would be automatically ruled out as well.

\citet{zhang2018leveraging} focus on incorporating deduced constraints
into the statistical model, to allow taking this info into account
in the decision of which branches to focus on.
Another similar effort has been that of \citet{odena2020learning},
which adds additional features describing properties of a function.
Types however have so far been missing here.

Compared to other neural methods, neural-guided search seems
more of a complementary than a competing effort.
The engineering involved to conciliate the benefits of
different approaches here may be quite involved, and as such
are likely less common in research papers comparing neural components,
their benefits in production systems seem clear.

% \pagebreak

\section{Methodology} % \label{sec:methodology}

To explain our design decisions in this domain,
we will go by the synthesizer taxonomy of \citet{gulwani2017program},
in which a synthesizer is typically characterized by three key dimensions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the kind of \emph{constraints} that it accepts as expression of \emph{user intent};
    \item the \emph{space} of programs over which it searches;
    \item the \emph{search technique} it employs.
\end{itemize}

The last point, the \emph{search technique}, is our synthesizer.
The first two points together give the background needed to understand both our dataset generation method as well as the synthesizer itself.

We will therefore first explain our design decisions with regard to user intent and program search space,
then continue to lay out the design of our dataset generation method and synthesizer.

One should bear in mind that our goal here is not to create the perfect production-ready synthesizer;
instead we will aim to answer each of these categories with the question:
what is the simplest way in which we might effectively test our hypotheses?

\subsection{User intent}

User intent in program synthesis can be expressed in various forms, including logical specification~\citep{temporalstreamlogic} (among which \emph{types}~\citep{synquid}),
input-output examples, traces, natural language~\citep{abstractsyntaxnetworks},
partial programs, or even related programs.~\citep{gulwani2017program}

As the constraints to express user intent, we would like to use \emph{input-output examples},
which may be considered a compromise between what is easier for the \emph{end-user},
who may ideally prefer natural-language descriptions of program behavior,
versus what is easier for the \emph{synthesizer},
which may ideally prefer a complete formal specification of program behavior.

This puts us in the field of programming by example (PBE),
which has a broad area of application despite being conceptually simple%
~\footnote{
    Although arguably the potential applications of synthesis from natural-language descriptions are even broader,
    in terms of computational requirements and dataset generation it is a much harder problem.
}.

To (1) reduce ambiguity, (2) increase result quality, and (3) speed up synthesis, a synthesizer may be passed more information in various ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item additional data within the same mode of user intent, e.g. further input-output examples;
    \item an additional expression of user intent of a different types, e.g. a natural language description~\citep{polosukhin2018neural} or type signature of the desired function~\citep{myth};
    \item more descriptive types~\citep{synquid};
    \item additional features describing properties of the function~\citep{odena2020learning}.
\end{itemize}

Of interest here is the realization here that, in modern programming languages, even without explicit type annotations types may be \emph{inferred}.
% TODO: implication: language preferably should have type inference
This is then a hidden benefit of synthesis from input-output examples:
if the types of input-output example pairs may be \emph{inferred}, then we may regard this as free additional information we can incorporate in our synthesis process.%
~\footnote{
    Optionally, it may be of interest to allow users to,
    in addition to the function types implied in their input-output examples,
    still let them explicitly clarify their desired function type manually as well.
    While on first glance this may seem potentially redundant with input-output pairs,
    it may actually help to constrain the potential function space to a sufficiently general form,
    benefiting both the user,
    by yielding a mode widely-applicable function,
    while also benefiting the synthesizer,
    by helping to constrain the search space.
}

\subsection{Program search space}

The program search space consists of the synthesis language (defined by a \emph{context-free grammar}),
either general-purpose or a \emph{domain-specific language} (DSL),
potentially further restricted to a subset of its original operators,
such as by providing a whitelist of \emph{operators}.

The trade-off here is one of expressiveness (can we write a satisfactory program, ideally using not too much code?) versus limiting our search space (ensure we can find a solution within too long).

So, how does this fit into our question on reaching a configuration that could best demonstrate the use of types?
Now, providing empirical evidence on how every design choice impacts the usefulness of type information is not in scope for this paper.
Instead, we will make informed guesses for some of the decisions involved here (language, grammar subset) to provide us with some level of flexibility,
then use that flexibility at the operator level and generate different datasets from these, to nevertheless provide empirical evidence on the effect some other decisions here (how do various properties of type signatures affect the usefulness of type information?).

Not having empirical evidence to guide our design decisions upfront, however,
we appear free to take some guidance from program search space considerations to generally improve synthesis efficiency:
how might we achieve the highest amount of expressiveness within a limited search space?
The answers we have find to this question, we argue,
intuitively appears in line with a program search space designed to demonstrate the utility in synthesis of type information.

Under this goal, it would seem preferable to pick a limited grammar in the functional programming paradigm using static typing.
In the following sections we will lay out how we have reached this conclusion.

\subsubsection{Static typing}

Of our goals of expressiveness versus a limited search space,
\emph{types} would seem able to help us primarily in limiting our search space:
we would like them to prune out any parts of the search space that are not sensible.

As we have laid out above,
types are nearly a \emph{free lunch} when it comes to restricting the synthesis search space,
as per our hypothesis \#1
% \ref{hyp:types}
thereby improving synthesis performance.
Aside from making it easier to automate programming,
static typing, as one step toward formal verification,
brings the additional advantage of helping reduce the
risk of potentially costly software failures.%
~\citep{miller2018smart,leveson2001systemic}

\paragraph{Types versus grammar: generics} \label{sec:generics}

However, one might note here that traditionally,
search spaces in program synthesis have been restricted not using types,
but using \emph{context-free grammars},
an approach that is the subject of the
\emph{Syntax-Guided Synthesis competition} (SyGuS-Comp)~\citep{sygus}.

One might wonder: how then would restrictions based on
types compare to restrictions imposed by a grammar?

In a \emph{monomorphic} type system,
containing only simple (unparametrized) types such as \emph{boolean} or \emph{integer},
restraining a search using types is in fact \emph{equivalent}
to a grammar where types are used as symbols in the grammar.
One might note that this equivalence does not imply
that neither of these approaches is preferable:
it in fact means that a simpler and more generic grammar
may achieve the same thing without losing expressivity,
allowing better reuse of logic.

However, although static typing has been around since the days of \emph{Fortran},
what makes the use of types different from,
and more powerful than grammars in restricting the search space,
is the use of \emph{parametric polymorphism}, i.e. availability \emph{type variables}:
a function \emph{append} may work using either lists of numbers or lists of strings.%
~\footnote{Left out of scope here are \emph{refinement types}, which further aid synthesis based on conditions.}
As such, its type signature may be made \emph{generic} such as to have its return type reflect the types of the parameters used.
Similarly, an \emph{identity} function could work on any different type, simply returning its input values.

Having such information available at the type level may add additional information over what is used in the simpler case above.
For example, a function to look up elements in a list based on their respective locations might take as its inputs one list containing any type of element, along with a second list of integers containing the indices.

Now, in a \emph{context-free} grammar,
such distinctions could not be expressed in a meaningful way:
while one might initially attempt to patch this by enumerating the different options for any symbolified parametric types in the grammar,
with the addition of new operations, types, parametric types, and higher-order parametric types,
such a grammar would quickly explode to the point of no longer remaining a reasonable abstraction to a human observer:
suddenly a hypothetical \emph{identity function} in the grammar, for one,
would need to be duplicated at the left-hand-side (LHS) level of the grammar for every known type in the grammar,
including for potential parametric types (list of booleans, list of integers, list of lists of booleans, \dots).

As such, one may regard the reliance of types over a grammar for the purpose of restricting the search space as a \emph{generalization} of solely relying on a \emph{grammar} for the purpose of restricting the search space.

Nevertheless, it should be noted here that not all programs benefit from this,
but only those for which potential building blocks (or \emph{operators}) do in fact include statically typed functions making use of either parametric return types, that is to say, return types containing type variables.

As a result, this restriction limits our method from adding value for direct synthesis of programming languages that are \emph{dynamically typed},
e.g. Ruby language, as well as those lacking \emph{parametric polymorphism}, e.g. Go language.
However, this only partly hinders those wishing to synthesize programs in such languages:
rather than synthesizing in such languages directly, we would suggest synthesizing from the language that \emph{best constrains} the search space,
then using source-to-source translation methods as discussed in section
% \ref{sec:source2source}
\ref{sec:synthtypes}
(e.g. neural machine translation~\citep{kalchbrenner2013recurrent}),
using the synthesized program as input to obtain a program translated into the target language.

\paragraph{Types versus expressiveness}

However, in order to nevertheless achieve a high degree of expressiveness,
we simultaneously require a type system powerful enough to model any logic we might wish to utilize.

Now, in order to \emph{further} restrain our search space as much as possible,
this means we would generally prefer to have our functions be as generally applicable as possible.

So far the best attempts at generalizing functionality in programming languages has taken after the abstractions discovered in \emph{category theory}~\citep{eilenberg1945general,awodey2010category},
a branch of mathematics 
% priding itself in generality to the point where it has earned the moniker \emph{abstract nonsense},
formalizing mathematical structure,
which defines abstract categories based on their defining properties.

The implication of this is that functions often used on a list structure,
such as \emph{map} or \emph{traverse},
would no longer be defined to take \emph{list}s,
but to instead operate on the more abstract categories of \emph{functor} and \emph{traversable},
both of which would the \emph{list} data structure would be a \emph{member} of,
generalizing their area of applicability to extend to other data structures as well.

Such abstractions will require a type system supporting constructs such as \emph{type classes}~\citep{blott1991type}.
This requirement narrows down our potential choice for a synthesis language to a select number of languages,
including Haskell, Clean, Rust, Mercury, Scala, Coq, Agda, and Idris.

\paragraph{Typed holes} \label{sec:holes}

In the context of program \emph{sketches} and \emph{partial programs} we had previously discussed the concept of \emph{holes},
i.e. the missing parts of a program that a synthesizer would still need to fill out.
In section \ref{sec:challengesnps} we had also mentioned the challenge of how traditionally we were only able to evaluate the quality of \emph{complete} programs.
Now, as a compromise in lieu of such a proper behavioral evaluation of a complete program,
we would like to be able to perform a \emph{type check} by means of a rudimentary provisional sanity check.%
~\footnote{
    While we are using our simple training setup using \emph{strong supervision},
    we cannot technically \emph{train} on \emph{compile feedback} yet,
    but at the very least we can already \emph{filter} on such compile checks during \emph{evaluation}.
}

Now, using most statically typed languages,
for the purpose of such a type-check we could simulate such holes by means of a \emph{dummy value}.
Many programming languages offer e.g. \emph{undefined} or \emph{null} values for this purpose,
and these will allow us to write an incomplete functional program template,
yet at the same time pretend our partial program is in fact \emph{complete}.

A more elegant solution for our purposes here is proper language support for such \emph{typed holes}~\citep{hashimoto1997typed},
as available in Agda~\citep{holesagda},
Idris~\citep{holesidris},
and Haskell~\citep{holeshaskell}.%
~\footnote{As we will explain later, each of these languages are implementations of the \emph{lambda calculus}.}
Typed holes enable type inference for any such holes,
in turn enabling suggested completions to the user.
Such interactive program synthesis has been labeled as the solver-aided
programming method \emph{sketching}~\citep{gulwani2017program} or
\emph{type-driven development}~\citep{typedrivendev}.

As such, one of our goals is to improve suggested hole completions in such languages to facilitate this interactive programming style.
On the other hand, we may also hook into such existing completion logic to inform our synthesizer.
% TODO: expand on this if in scope, add to follow-up suggestions if out of scope

\subsubsection{Functional programming}

% TODO: insert pics of like function composition (f . g) and a lambda function definition of the identity function; two important constructs characterizing functional programming.

The \emph{functional} paradigm,
named after the \emph{pure} functions of \emph{mathematics},
has been characterized by its composability or \emph{modularity}~\citep{hughes1989functional},
which is key in the creation of synthesizers that generalize well,
as it encourages \emph{reusing} existing abstractions to allow for a large expressivity using only a small vocabulary,
matching our synthesizer search space requirement of maintaining \emph{expressiveness} while limiting our \emph{search space}.

In addition, functional programming offers various general-purpose programming languages,
which helps potentially make our synthesizer potentially applicable to a wide variety of domains.
It is also well amenable to programming \emph{types},
allowing advanced constructs such as
algebraic datatypes (ADTs)~\citep{burstall1977design},
generalized algebraic datatypes (GADTs)~\citep{dybjer1991logical},
and, more importantly for our purposes, type classes~\citep{blott1991type}.
While \citet{haskellhistory} provides an overview of these,
the point for our purpose is that these features contribute to expressiveness,
and simultaneously, help reduce the search space in program synthesis.

As such, program synthesis approaches using types have in fact commonly focused on using functional programming languages as the synthesis language.%
~\citep{synquid,eguchi2018automated,scythe,scout,gissurarson2018suggesting,idris,lenses}

So the basic abstraction in functional programming is the \emph{function}.
This means we would view our synthesized programs as being and consisting of \emph{pure functions}~\citep{fortran95},
i.e. returning a deterministic output for any given inputs,
without performing any additional side effects.%
~\footnote{
    These properties of determinism and lack of side effects are generally taken as prerequisites in \emph{programming by example},
    as we will verify program behavior by comparing the output of our synthesized output to that of our original task function.
    If \emph{non-determinism} came into play,
    forcing us to test samples of our stochastic function output,
    we would need to extend our synthesis domain to something that could well be called \emph{synthesis by property} instead.
    Synthesizing functions with \emph{side effects} instead appears closer to the domain of synthesis from \emph{traces},
    where the synthesis specification instead consists of a description of such triggered side effects as a function of various user inputs.
}
The concept of \emph{purity} comes directly from that of the \emph{mathematical function} that this paradigm is named after.
The nice thing about such a pure function is that it satisfies some properties like \emph{referential transparency} making it easier to reason about,
by allowing us to substitute any pure expression with its calculated result,
as we will see in section \ref{sec:lambdacalc}.

One may well regard \emph{programs} in this paradigm as constructed of a (nested) tree of function applications.
One \emph{reason} we would like to consider such programs of a tree-based form,
rather than as a list of imperative statements such as variable definitions or mutations,
is that the view of programs as function compositions guarantees us that any complete type-checking program from the root,
filtered to the right output type,
\emph{will} yield us output of the desired type,%
~\footnote{
    Technically this holds for in as far as we our functions are \emph{fully} or \emph{partially} applied to the extent they will give us the desired result,
    something we will keep in mind when choosing our program \emph{expansion rules} later on.
}
helping us reduce our synthesis search space to a sensible subset,
devoid of e.g. programs containing variable definitions that end up never being used.

This guarantees that, rather than just branching out,
our search will focus on finding acceptable solutions.
This is to be contrasted with \emph{imperative} programs,
a coding style characterized by variable mutation,
historically popularized for the purpose of performance optimization from the earlier languages such as \emph{assembly}.
Synthesis for such languages exists as well~\citep{shi2019frangel},
but is generally harder as it cannot make as much use of types.

The functional programming paradigm started with \emph{Lisp},
an implementation of the \emph{lambda calculus},
which has essentially formed the basis for functional programming languages ever since.
To give a better idea of how this works we will first explain how the lambda calculus itself works,
then discuss how this fits into the \emph{language features} we are looking for in a synthesis language,
to then finally use this knowledge to inform our decision on an actual synthesis language.

\subsubsection{Lambda calculus} \label{sec:lambdacalc}

Whereas modern programming languages might have a broad plethora of grammatical constructs available,
for the purpose of our proof-of-concept we will opt to hide much of this.

Types are most powerful in a setting where the underlying DSL is loosely-constrained,
that is, permits arbitrary type-safe combinations of subexpressions,
such that checks be deferred from the grammar to the type level.
In other words, to keep things simple,
our DSL should ideally support such a notion of an expression,
but preferably as little else as possible.

This brings us to the \emph{lambda calculus}~\citep{lambdacalculus},
the simplest~\citep{selinger2008lecture}
\emph{Turing-complete}~\citep{turing1936computable} grammar.
The lambda calculus requires only three grammatical categories:
variables, function definition, and function application.
One simple example showcasing all three of these is (($\lambda$x.x) z).

Working from the inner expression ($\lambda$x.x),
we have a function definition that given a parameter that we will name $x$, will return the value $x$.
Our outer expression (($\lambda$x.x) z), then,
invokes a function \emph{application} on this function,
using as its sole argument the variable $z$.
$z$ will then be bound to the value of the parameter $x$.
To reflect this, we may rewrite the function body $x$ by substituting parameter $x$ with $z$.
Our full expression has at this point been simplified to just $z$,
yielding our final result.%
~\footnote{
    Simplifying by function application this way is also known in the lambda calculus as $\beta$-\emph{reduction},
    corresponding to \emph{local reducibility} in \emph{natural deduction}~\citep{gentzen1935untersuchungen}.
}

Understanding the basics,
it would be illuminating to go over a slightly more involved example (($\lambda$x.$\lambda$y.$\lambda$z. + x y) 1 2),
including a binary arithmetic addition operator $+$ taken two arguments of a numeric type,
two actual numeral literals we will use as arguments,
and three nested functions with respective parameters $x$, $y$, and $z$.
As before, our main expression is a function application containing two parameters, $1$ and $2$,
which we will apply left-to-right.
Applying our first argument, substituting our parameter $x$ with $1$,
we obtain (($\lambda$y.$\lambda$z. + 1 y) 2).
Applying our second argument, substituting $y$ with $2$,
we then get ($\lambda$z. + 1 2).
No longer having any symbolic variables in our inner function application now,
we can now simplify it, leaving us with ($\lambda$z. 3),
i.e. a unary function ignoring its sole parameter value to return $3$.

What this example demonstrates is the concept of \emph{currying}~\citep{currying},
that is, the ability to separately apply function arguments without our function necessarily being applied \emph{fully}.%
~\footnote{
    This is in contrast to functions in e.g. traditional programming languages such as \emph{C},
    where a function with two parameters could only be \emph{fully applied},
    that is, applied with both of its parameters at once.
    And in fact, currying requires a language to support functions as \emph{first-class citizens},
    i.e. allowing to use functions as function arguments or return values.
}
As such, a \emph{curried} version of a function is not unlike its original form,
yet allowing arguments to the function to be applied to it one at a time.
The way this works is that, when an argument is applied to a curried form of a function taking two parameters,
the result is a function that still takes one parameter, before yielding the actual result of the original function.
This is particularly useful to \emph{compose} existing functionality,
and this idea of functions operating on other functions is also called a \emph{combinator}.

With this lambda calculus, we now have a solid basis for a simple expressive grammar that allows us to defer most checks from the grammar to the type level.%
~\footnote{
    As an interesting coincidence,
    using this as the basis of our synthesis target language means
    we will use an implementation of \citet{lambdacalculus}'s lambda calculus
    to address \citet{church1957applications}'s problem of synthesizing programs.
}

\subsubsection{Grammatical subset}

Now, while the lambda calculus looks like a promising start,
how does it relate to the simple DSL we seek to test our hypotheses?
Surely, a language would traditionally require various grammatical constructs to support e.g.
literal values, variable definitions, infix operators such as the mathematical addition operator $+$, return statements, conditionals, and more?

As we discussed in section \ref{sec:holes},
for the purpose of expressing \emph{partial} programs,
one features missing in the lambda calculus that we will require in our DSL is that of \emph{holes},
ideally \emph{typed} (whether explicitly or implicitly) just as the rest of our programs.

Otherwise, however, we will argue that for our purposes,
we actually need \emph{less},
not \emph{more} than,
what is offered by the lambda calculus for the purpose of our \emph{synthesizer} DSL.%
~\footnote{
    We will however allow expressions including arbitrary grammar constructs in our user-defined \emph{operator definitions} ---
    while we will infer the \emph{types} of these operator definitions and interpret them to \emph{run} our synthesized programs,
    our synthesizer itself does not need to concern itself with the internals of these definitions,
    or generate similar definitions itself.
    The \emph{synthesizer} DSL only needs to concern itself with the grammatical constructs that our synthesizer will actually be tasked with \emph{producing} itself.
}

% infix operators such as the mathematical addition operator $+$

Viewing traditional operators such as \emph{addition} as (curried) functions for one,
as we have done in section \ref{sec:lambdacalc},
can both simplify the way we view things,
while also increasing expressiveness.
And in fact, this is indeed what happens in various functional languages,
where traditional operators such as \verb|+| are viewed simply as infix operator forms of curried functions.

In Haskell language, for example, \verb|+| may be used to refer to the addition operator in infix notation,
whereas \verb|(+)| may be used to refer to its form as a traditional function.
Other languages such as OCaml, Idris and Agda follow a similar pattern.
In other words, even if we want our DSL to support e.g. arithmetic operations,
we may just express these using our existing concept of \emph{functions},
rather than adding such functionality at the \emph{grammar} level.

% conditionals

As such, we might express as curried functions not only basic \emph{mathematical} operators,
but by wrapping them as library functions,
also traditional \emph{grammatical} constructs as (functional) \emph{conditionals} and function composition operators.%
\footnote{
    Whereas for \emph{legibility} purposes, a programmer may prefer to read code using a grammar rich with \emph{syntactical sugar},
    for the purpose of program \emph{synthesis},
    it is preferable to decouple the syntax used for synthesis from that presented to the reader,
    so as to prevent duplication during synthesis to restrict the search as much as possible.
    Instead, a synthesized program might then be \emph{converted} so as to use a more legible grammar.
    For the purpose of this thesis, we will not focus on reader-friendly syntax, however.
}

% literal values

To simplify the problem for the purpose of our experiment,
we would furthermore disallow the use of arbitrary values such as free-style numbers or strings \emph{as generated by our synthesizer}.%
Instead, in order to keep this tractable we will constrain ourselves to user-supplied constants.
A proper solution here may involve e.g. \emph{version space algebras} (VSAs).~\citep{mitchell1982generalization}

% variable definitions

Having \emph{variable definitions} would typically allow us to reduce duplication in our program,
or in the event of values derived from calculations that are non-deterministic or have side-effects,
reuse such values across our program.
Since the \emph{programming by example} context (without further generalization) forces us to stick to \emph{pure} functions however,
for our purposes, synthesizer-generated variable definitions might at best help reduce duplication.
Therefore, within our present scope we may settle for accepting this duplication in favor of further simplicity.

% function definitions

As a final simplification, we will also leave out the \emph{function definitions} as provided by the lambda calculus.
Together with not doing synthesizer-defined variables, this helps forego additional complications such as variable name hygiene and (optionally~\footnote{
    Technically, rather than letting the synthesizer actively generate scoped variable definition lists, we could also just have it generate \emph{unscoped} variables. However, to prevent any optional complexity we will skip out on either of these.
}) variable scope.
Instead of using such function definitions,
we would instead like to stick to the simpler \emph{point-free} style.
In other words, we would like to leave out redundant \emph{variable names} where possible,
i.e. to go from ($\lambda$x. + 1 x) to just $(+ 1)$.%
~\footnote{
    In lambda calculus this simplification is titled $\eta$-\emph{reduction},
    corresponding to \emph{local completeness} in \emph{natural deduction}~\citep{gentzen1935untersuchungen}.
}
The utility of this point-free style is further amplified by the presence of \emph{currying},
which allows us to \emph{partially apply} a function,
then pass its resulting function in a point-free manner.%
~\footnote{Restrictions with regard to parameter order here may be further alleviated using \emph{argument-flipping} combinators.}

All these restrictions should together leave us with a limited wishlist for our grammar:
referencing variables from our dataset-defined \emph{operators},
and applying expressions as arguments to functions.
Note that either of these two also results in an expression.
Our synthesizer DSL has therefore ended up with the subset of the
lambda calculus containing only variables and function application,
yet not function definition.
Hopefully, our hypotheses may be tested without this additional complexity.

\subsubsection{Synthesis language}

Our \emph{synthesis} language, or \emph{target} language,
is the language we would like for our synthesizer to generate.
This is as opposed to the \emph{host} language,
i.e. the language that our synthesizer is implemented \emph{in}.
While these are separate design decisions,
they are regarded as separate more so in some
branches of program synthesis than in others.

\emph{Neural} synthesis methods, for one,
have often tended to implement custom DSLs as the target language,
while for the host language typically using \emph{Python}~\citep{rossum1995python},
a dynamically typed language that has become popular in the
data science and machine learning domains as it offered
easy integration with existing scientific computing codebases
written in \emph{Fortran}, \emph{C}, and \emph{C++}~\citep{mckinney2012python},
particularly the \emph{basic linear algebra subprograms} (BLAS)~\citep{lawson1979basic},
which have formed the basis of the \emph{Numpy}~\citep{oliphant2006guide} tensor library.
More important for the Python ecosystem in recent years has
been the introduction of \emph{deep learning frameworks}%
~\citep{pytorch,abadi2016tensorflow,jax2018github},
which built on top of the ideas of Numpy
to add acceleration using devices able to run computations in parallel,
including \emph{graphics processing units} (GPUs),
\emph{application-specific integrated circuits} (ASICs) such as Google's \emph{tensor processing units} (TPUs),
and \emph{field-programmable gate arrays} (FPGAs)
including Microsoft's \emph{neural processing units} (NPUs);
along with \emph{automatic differentiation}%
~\citep{neidinger2010introduction,baydin2017automatic}
to automate implementation of backward passes of
\emph{backpropagation}~\citep{backproprnn}
in machine learning models.

For our purposes working with types however,
it would be nice to be able to defer type logic to an existing language,
ideally without having to rely on
\emph{foreign function interfaces} (FFIs)
to glue languages together.
This idea though would require our host language
to be able to construct ASTs for, compile,
and interpret our \emph{target} language,
while also requiring the availability of a
deep learning framework for our model implementations.

While we have so far glossed over the intersection
between type systems and the lambda calculus,
the \emph{typed lambda calculus},
by the Curry-Howard isomorphism~\citep{howard1980formulae} corresponding to
\emph{natural deduction}~\citep{gentzen1935untersuchungen} in logic,
actually consists of been different variants.%
~\footnote{
    On a sidenote, type-level guarantees on the lambda calculus do technically
    come at the expense of expressiveness in terms of its
    Turing-completeness~\citep{draheim2017semantics},
    although this hasn't really prevented it from being put to practical use.
}

\citet{barendregt_1991}'s \emph{lambda cube} offers a
taxonomy of such type systems for the lambda calculus,
each corresponding to a different branch of logic.
It is based on the presence of
\emph{parametric polymorphism}, i.e. parameterized types,
\emph{dependent types}~\citep{martin1984intuitionistic},
i.e. types whose definition depends on a value%
~\footnote{
    This variant is called the $\lambda-\Pi$-\emph{calculus}%
    ~\citep{pym1991proof,milner1992functions,boudol1998pi},
    combining the lambda calculus with the $\pi$-\emph{calculus}~\citep{engberg1986calculus}.
},
and \emph{type operators},
i.e. the 'function' equivalent using types for values.

Their taxonomy starts with the 
\emph{simply-typed lambda calculus}~\citep{church1940formulation},
offering none of these features,
and ending with the \emph{calculus of constructions}~\citep{coquand1986calculus},
offering all three.

Theorem prover \emph{Coq}~\citep{barras1997coq} implements the
\emph{calculus of inductive constructions}~\citep{huet1987induction},
a derivative of the calculus of constructions further adding \emph{inductive types}.
\emph{System F}~\citep{girard1971extension},
the combination adding only parametric polymorphism,
also known as the \emph{polymorphic} or \emph{second-order lambda calculus},
is implemented in \emph{Haskell}~\citep{jones2003haskell} and in
\emph{ML} dialects such as \emph{Standard ML}~\citep{harper1986standard},
\emph{OCaml}~\citep{leroy2014ocaml}, and \emph{F\#}~\citep{syme2005f}.
\emph{Agda}~\citep{norell2008dependently} and
\emph{Idris}~\citep{idris} add dependent types on top of these,
corresponding to \emph{second-order predicate calculus},
putting them only one step away in the cube from the calculus of constructions.
Further extensions to the lambda cube taxonomy have been proposed as well.%
~\citep{berardi1988towards,roorda2001pure,guallart2015overview}

Now, as per \citet{gulwani2017program},
any ML-like calculus with algebraic datatypes can serve as a core language for type-driven synthesis;
we can use types without dependent types or type operators as well.

In summary, our ideal target language is a lambda calculus
typed to offer at least polymorphic parametrism (System F),
further offering type inference, and ideally typeclasses
and typed holes.
In our host language, we are looking for a deep learning framework,
along with the ability to construct ASTs for, compile, and interpret our target language.

Note that the target and host languages may in fact be the same language,
and in fact, as our host language tasks closely resembly the
tasks of a compiler or interpreter of the target language,
for languages featuring \emph{bootstrapped} compilers,
i.e. written in their own language,
such tooling in fact \emph{will} likely be most readily available in the language itself,
potentially making a compelling case for keeping target and host languages identical.

Given this list of requirements,
we are seeing a general conflict of interest between
our requirements of the host and target languages,
where our target language wishlist would bias us toward more fully-featured languages,
whereas particularly the host language requirement of a deep learning
framework would pull us toward the more-established languages,
as maintaining such a framework is typically a fairly ambitious endeavour.
Simultaneously, our target and source languages
would need to be fairly close in terms of interop,
given our host language requirements of having to be
able to manipulate/compile/interpret target language ASTs.

While these stringent requirements appear to have so far commonly deterred
researchers from combining type-aided synthesis with neural synthesis methods,
we have found a way to conciliate these requirements
by sharing as the host and target language
\emph{Haskell}~\citep{jones2003haskell}, which is a statically typed,
purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation,
which further enables dealing with infinite data structures.
%~\footnote{Source: \url{https://wiki.haskell.org/Lazy_evaluation}}

This configuration turned out to fill every requirement we had,
while following the use of this language in various synthesis papers on non-neural methods%
~\citep{synquid,hornclauses,scythe,gissurarson2018suggesting}.%
~\footnote{
    For future researchers interested in expanding synthesis research toward target languages featuring \emph{dependent types},
    it may be of interest to look into \emph{Agda},
    which was implemented in Haskell,
    so should be viable to manipulate and interpret from Haskell as well.
    While \emph{Idris} had also started out this way,
    allowing for a similar setup,
    its second iteration has bootstrapped its compiler,
    severing the tie with Haskell.
}
Of these, perhaps the least obvious was the presence of a deep learning framework,
as this required us to use a third-party library.

For this purpose, we had evaluated Haskell ports of
the most popular deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow.
At the moment of choosing, the Haskell port of PyTorch,
named \emph{HaskTorch}~\citep{hasktorch}%
~\footnote{
    HaskTorch has an API essentially modeled after PyTorch, as it is wrapping the same C++ codebase.
    It additionally features a second parallel 'typed' API however,
    which offers extra static checks of tensor details such as dimensions.

    While the original API will limit learning curve for those coming from PyTorch,
    in implementing our (non-trivial) model we found it quite helpful
    to make use of the typed API for the extra compiler checks.

    We did run into some learning curve there as well,
    such as how to dynamically determine hyperparameters
    which static tensor typing expects to know at compile-time,
    e.g. to let users pass these as command-line flags,
    or to search over these as part of hyperparameter optimization.
    We aim to further lay these out in a future blog post.
},
turned out the significantly more active of the two,
and along with its welcoming and helpful community solidified our choice.

\subsubsection{Grammar \emph{unrolling}} \label{sec:unroll}

We had previously discussed that our synthesis DSL,
i.e. the grammar to be actively produced by our synthesizer,
only requiring a subset of the functionality in the lambda calculus,
that is, function application and referencing variables,
though without function definition.

% As a result, our Haskell-based grammar ends up looking as follows:
% \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
%     type & constructor & Type Parameters & example & note \\
%     Exp & App & Exp Exp & exp exp & \\
%     Exp & ExpTypeSig & Exp Type & exp \textbf{::} type & \\
%     Exp & Paren & Exp & \textbf{(}exp\textbf{)} & \\
%     Exp & Var & QName & qname & \\
%     % Type & TyApp & Type Type & Type Type & \\
%     % Type & TyCon & QName & QName & \\
%     % Type & TyFun & Type Type & Type \textbf{->} Type & \\
%     % Type & TyVar & Name & name & \\
%     % QName & UnQual & Name & name & redundant \\
%     % QName & Special & SpecialCon & specialCon & redundant \\
%     % Name & Ident & & ident & \\
%     SpecialCon & ExprHole & & \textbf{\_} & \\
%     % SpecialCon & ListCon & & \textbf{[]} & \\
%     % Exp & Lambda & [Pat] Exp & \textbf{\textbackslash} patt1 patt2 ... \textbf{->} exp & lambdas \\
%     % Pat & PVar & Name & name & lambdas, redundant \\
%     % Exp & Let & Binds Exp & \textbf{let} binds \textbf{in} exp & lambdas typed without ScopedTypeVariables \\
%     % Binds & BDecls & [Decl] & decl1\textbf{;} decl2\textbf{;} ... & lambdas typed without ScopedTypeVariables \\
%     % Decl & PatBind & Pat Rhs (Maybe Binds) & pat \textbf{=} rhs & lambdas typed without ScopedTypeVariables \\
%     % Rhs & UnGuardedRhs & Exp & exp & lambdas typed without ScopedTypeVariables, redundant \\
% \end{tabular}

As a \emph{context-free grammar},
taking inspiration from the notation of \emph{extended Backus–Naur form} (EBNF)~\citep{standard1996ebnf},
this would look as follows:%
~\footnote{
    It may initially seem surprising that this grammar only directly describes \emph{unary} function application.
    However, if one recalls the \emph{currying} aspect of the lambda calculus,
    this should not come as a surprise: after all,
    applying multiple parameters to a function in one go
    is equivalent to applying them one by one.
}

\begin{verbatim}
expr = "(", expr, " ", expr, ")";
expr = <any variable contained in our whitelisted operators>;
\end{verbatim}

As such, given an operator list consisting of operators \emph{and} and \emph{false},
we would then obtain the following valid EBNF:

\begin{verbatim}
expr = "(", expr, " ", expr, ")";
expr = "and" | "false";
\end{verbatim}

Now, in practice, we would like to support using different operator sets,
so it is fortunate we did not need to fix these at the grammar level itself.
However, for the purpose of a naive synthesizer,
there is a problem with this simple version of our grammar,
were we to allow it to use this for generative purposes.
The issue here being that,
while a grammar should aim to enable valid productions while weeding out bad ones,
this grammar still enables generating some bad programs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item programs where the argument of a function is not of the right type.
        This class of mistakes we are no longer able to reliably solve
        at the grammar level due to our polymorphic parametrism.
        Instead, we wish to def this kind of check to the \emph{type} level.
    \item programs where the arity of a given operator is not respected, i.e.
        by invoking more \emph{function applications} than we up-front know are supported.
\end{itemize}

The latter problem we can deal with in either of two ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item we ignore the problem by deferring it to the type-level,
    providing a solution consistent with how we handle problems of the former type.
    \item we reframe the grammar by statically \emph{unrolling} any provided operators such as to ensure only valid function arities are supported.
\end{itemize}

We consider the second option to be preferable from the synthesizer perspective;
although this would \emph{expand} the number of production rules in the grammar,
different numbers of function application for a given operator yield different \emph{result types}.
For a type-based synthesizer, distinguishing these \emph{makes sense},
as this distinction should facilitate learning.%
~\footnote{
    This take is still up for empirical validation.
    An alternative take may be that the unknown type for a function argument,
    resulting in reduced operator confidence,
    would simply lead a synthesizer to prefer filling a different hole.

    Moreover, the \emph{unrolled} grammar approach implies upfront known arities of functions' argument and return types%
    % ~\footnote{
    %     For in as far as one may speak of arities in a language based on the lambda calculus
    %     using a synthesizer grammar specifically modeled after the lambda calculus.
    % }
    ,
    which is not in fact the case for such generic functions as the \emph{identity function},
    which may take and return e.g. numbers yet also other functions,
    and more importantly, for functions such as the \emph{argument flipping} combinator
    as well as for the \emph{function composition combinator},
    both of which may operate on functions of any arity.

    This poses a significant limitation for the \emph{unrolled} approach:
    it essentially means such arity-agnostic combinators are not supported,
    which in the context of functional programming feels like an undesirable limitation.

    While we acknowledge the limitations of this present approach,
    considering the operator set we would like to use in our experiments,
    which we will introduce in section \ref{sec:datagen},
    we will consider this as sufficient for the purpose of our present paper.

}

As an example, let's say our operator list again contains the two operators from above,
one operator \emph{and} as a curried function taking at most two arguments,
and one operator \emph{false}, a variable that does not describe a function,
and therefore may take no arguments.

Our \emph{unrolled} grammar would then look as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
expr = "(and ", expr, " ", expr, ")";
expr = "(and ", expr, ")";
expr = "and";
expr = "false";
\end{verbatim}

As with the above-mentioned grammars,
EBNF notation should alternatively allow us to express
this same grammar using only a single production rule,
a disjunction of the different options.%
~\footnote{
    These should in fact be equivalent,
    and the ability to express our grammar as such should demonstrate its elegance,
    only requiring the single left-hand side symbol of \emph{expression}.

    For the purpose of our synthesizer, however,
    we prefer thinking of these as production rules that merit distinction,
    as we will have our synthesizer learn of these as distinct options.
}

It must be noted that context-free grammars
as the above
describe how to generate \emph{full programs} in the associated grammar.
However, our synthesizer only \emph{gradually} synthesizes programs,
only one such rule expansion at a time.
As such, in \emph{partial programs},
we express the unresolved \emph{expr} symbols as
\emph{holes} or \emph{dummy variables} such as \emph{undefined}.
% TODO: which one?

For the purpose of running our synthesized programs,
we must additionally ensure our whitelisted operators are in scope for our program.
We then obtain our actual Haskell program to be interpreted
by wrapping our synthesized program in a \emph{let}-expression%
~\footnote{
    Operators where the body is equal to their name we filter out from such let-expressions.
    This is because, in Haskell,
    a definition containing its own name would be taken as recursive,
    causing non-termination.
    As such, we first filter out those 'recursive' operators,
    then for each remaining operator track
    whether it has been used in any given program.
}
containing the relevant operator definitions, as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
    let
        false = <expr>;
        and = <expr>;
        ...
    in body
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Operator whitelist}

Our synthesis approach itself is agnostic to the set of operators used,
allowing for relatively straight-forward experimentation with different sets of operators.
In fact, adding new operators largely concerns dataset generation, and is only a matter of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item adding the actual operators, together with their definitions;
    \item updating the list of used types for randomized type instantiation;
    \item updating random generation to ensure it incorporates used types;
    \item running the dataset generation to ensure our synthesizer has data from which to learn about our new operators;
    \item actually training our synthesizer using our updated dataset including our new operators.
\end{itemize}

% % TODO: which operators and why
% As the actual set of operators most conducive to benefiting
% from type information is subject to empirical investigation,
% we will further expand on different operator sets used
% and their respective results in section \ref{sec:experiment}.

We will further expand on our operator set
in section \ref{sec:experiment}.

\subsection{Dataset generation} \label{sec:datagen}

% The process for generating task functions to train our synthesizer on is as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item we start using a body consisting of a hole, typed with a wildcard;
%     \item we use hole-filling to generate potential complete programs within a certain complexity threshold.
% \end{itemize}

% We additionally considered alternative methods of generating task functions:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item generating a function based on a type signature;
%     \item generating a function based on an input parameter type; % , then filling holes, only afterwards seeing what return type ends up coming out.    
% \end{itemize}
% There are two reasons we decided against using these type-first approaches:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item as they impose constraints on the functions generated, they will end up generating less functions given the same amount of compute;
%     \item if we wanted to allow generating more general versions of the desired function, then fixing the types upfront such as not to allow more generic implementations feels counter-productive, if not anti-thetical to the spirit of functional programming.
% \end{itemize}

% genBlockVariants
First off, we generate variants to \emph{unroll} each operator in the dataset
as described in section \ref{sec:unroll},
using a different number of holes corresponding to any applicable arity.
% By our control variable \emph{maxWildcardDepth} we allow imposing a maximum
% level of functions to imagine in a wildcard for function generation.

% genFns

To create our dataset of task functions,
we start from an expression consisting of only a hole,
then step by step generate any type-checking permutation
by filling a hole in such an expression using our above operator variants.
% so as to just directly generate any functions in batch,
% and see what types end up coming out.
We use a control variable \emph{maxHoles} to set a limit on
the number of holes to fill in a generated expression.

Note that as we add sub-expressions to our program,
our total type signature may incur type variables,
which we may then use when adding new sub-expressions.
If such a new sub-expression would expect a type constraint on this type variable,
the constraint is then automatically propagated up to our root type signature.

Thus, whereas \citet{nsps} uniformly sample programs from the DSL,
we presently reserve sampling for the generation of
concrete types (for instantiating type variables) and of sample values,
while program permutations we exhaustively generate given the imposed limitations.

While we quickly mentioned type-checking programs to filter out bad ones,
we had yet to expand on this practice:
we presently use a Haskell interpreter to type-check our generated programs at run-time,
filter out non-function programs,
and check if program types look \emph{sane}:
to weed out some programs we deem less commonly useful%
~\footnote{
    Programs not passing these checks are not necessarily invalid,
    but by our engineering judgement,
    are much more circumstantial in their usage.
    For this reason, we would currently prefer for our synthesizer to focus on
    the region of our search space that we generally deem to be of higher interest.
},
we filter out types \emph{containing} functions (e.g. list of functions),
as well as types with constraints that span more than a single type variable (e.g. \verb|(Eq (a -> Bool)) => a|).

% genTypes
We generate a fixed number of concrete types we will use for instantiating type variables.
Using a \emph{nestLimit} control variable here we dictate the maximum number of nesting,
to prevent generating types like 'list of lists of booleans'.
The maximum number of types generated is dictated by control variable \emph{maxInstances},
although this may get less after deduplicating such sampled type instances.

We then use these concrete types to instantiate any polymorphic
(non-function) input types occurring in our task functions.
In the event the type variables in our types here involve \emph{type constraints},
% matchesConstraints
we ensure to only instantiate such type variables using our concrete types that satisfy the applicable type constraints.
% Our approach here presently only handles type variables here of a \emph{unary kind}.

% instantiateTypes
This yields us a set of concrete potential input types,
for which we proceed to generate sample values,
up to a given maximum number as indicated by our control variable \emph{numInputs},
although this may get less after filtering out duplicates.
We use control parameters to indicate range restrictions for different types here;
\emph{numMin} and \emph{numMax} for integer values,
\emph{listMin} and \emph{listMax} for the possible number of elements in a generated list.

For any given given task function type signature,
we then check for the types of each of their input parameters,
and take any corresponding combinations of instantiations for these types.

% genInputs
Now, for any non-function parameter types,
we may just take the previously generated sample values for those types.
% matchesType
Parameter function types, however,
we instead instantiate to function values by just taking
any of our generated task functions corresponding to that type.

% fnOutputs
Based on these sample inputs, we would then like to generate corresponding outputs for our generated task functions.
For our task functions that are polymorphic, i.e. contain type variables,
we must do this separately for different type instantiations.

% fnIoPairs

% As we only have the programs and inputs as ASTs,
% we also only know the types at run-time,
% which is when the programs are constructed.
% Therefore,
We run our programs using our run-time Haskell interpreter.
Using a flag \emph{crashOnError} we determine whether to
just crash on error while calculating function outputs,
or perform an additional typecheck (slower).
We catch run-time errors on specific inputs such that
we can regard these errors as just another resulting output
that our synthesizer should consider when comparing behavior between programs.
In other words, a \emph{partial function},
i.e. a function that only works on certain inputs of the desired input types,
may still constitute a valid program that we may wish to learn to synthesize.

Having generated input/output examples for our task functions,
we finally filter out any programs for which we have somehow failed to generate such samples.
At this point we:
\begin{itemize}
    \item use a random split to divide our task functions over training, validation and test sets;
    \item calculate the longest examples in our dataset (as string), when considering types (as per our experiment) also for those;
    \item track any characters used in the expressions in our dataset
    (for our type experiment also those used in the types),
    and assign them to indices for our one-hot encodings of examples (and their associated types).    
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Preventing \emph{cheating}}

Now, in \emph{supervised learning} settings,
one would typically ensure labeled samples would not be \emph{duplicated} across sets:
if we train a classifier on a cat picture,
then evaluate it on this same cat picture,
we would essentially allow the classifier to 'cheat' by simply remembering the examples,
rather than learning how to generalize in its task to \emph{unseen} samples.

In \emph{programming by example} on the other hand,
the equivalent isn't simply to ensure \emph{task functions} are deduplicated across sets.
Imagine we had two distinct task functions exhibiting identical behavior:
if one were allocated to our training set,
another to the test set,
then we have again created an opportunity for our synthesizer to cheat:
it could remember the program from our training set,
then synthesize it during evaluation.

While this program would not be the \emph{same},
for the purpose of synthesis \emph{evaluation} of accuracy,
synthesizing a function exhibiting the correct behavior already qualifies as successful synthesis,
as synthesizing \emph{one specific} function implementation is not the goal of programming by example.

Now, one would then presume that as long as we then ensure
that functions across different datasets
would not share the same \emph{input-output pairs},
this issue would be averted.

However, the reality is slightly more complicated still:
presume we have an \emph{increment} function mapping input $0$ to $1$,
along with a \emph{successor} function mapping $0$ to $1$ and \emph{false} to \emph{true}.

If we would simply deduplicate by identical input-output pairs,
we would conclude these functions to behave differently,
and would accept e.g. having the \emph{successor} function in our training set,
the \emph{increment} function in our test set.

This again leads us to a similar same problem however:
our synthesizer could simply memorize how to synthesize our \emph{successor} function,
then during evaluation use this knowledge to pass our \emph{increment} synthesis test.
As such, the solution would be to ensure we cannot \emph{train} on task functions exhibiting all of the behaviors of a function we would \emph{evaluate} on.

  TODO: clarify how I will tackle this
% TODO: clarify how I will tackle this

% dedupeFunctions: not in use; deduplicate functions by identical types + io, keeping the shortest

\subsection{Search technique}

\subsubsection{Our adaptation of neuro-symbolic program synthesis} \label{sec:ournsps}

Type-based approaches typically call for a \emph{top-down search strategy}.
As such, we will need to build upon AST-based (or node-based) rather than sequential (or token-based) neural synthesis methods.

As a benchmark algorithm we will therefore use the neuro-symbolic program synthesis method introduced in \citet{nsps} and further explained in section \ref{sec:nsps},
a top-down incremental neural synthesis method which like other neural methods is not presently making use of type-level information,
as it was originally designed for the \emph{FlashFill}~\citep{prose} domain.

The reason we picked this as our benchmark in particular is that there have been only few neural synthesizers out there based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs), rather than sequences.
This is important for us because we can apply types to an AST containing holes,
which we may not be able to do for any given \emph{sequence} representing a partial program.

While the paper follows a \emph{strongly supervised} training method,
this is not as straight-forward in the field of AST-based neural program synthesis as it using sequence-based generative methods.
In the latter, one would generate e.g. one character at a time,
meaning after comparing predictions to the next character used in the \emph{task function},
one may simply take \emph{that} next character,
and repeat the process on predictions based on this new longer sequence.
However, when we are filling holes in an AST,
there is no longer an evident equivalent to the 'next character' we in our sequence-based scenario:
we could potentially fill \emph{any} of our holes based on our task program.
While \citet{nsps} did not go into the workings of their training supervision method,
we have here settled for the naive approach of \emph{randomly} picking a hole to fill using a \emph{uniform distribution}.
The reason we picked against \emph{deterministically} choosing a hole to fill is
we would like to offer our synthesizer an equal opportunity to learn about different scenarios,
as we will further discuss in section \ref{sec:picking}.

\citet{nsps} suggest conditioning programs on samples in the R3NN can use either a
\emph{Multi-Layer Perceptron} (MLP)~\citep{rosenblatt1961principles} or a (bidirectional) LSTM,
where the LSTM could learn more about the relative position of each leaf node in the tree.
As such, we have opted to use the LSTM for this purpose.

They additionally note having found an improvement adding a bidirectional LSTM to process the global leaf representations, right before calculating the scores.
As such, we have incorporated this addition as well.

While not indicated in the paper itself,
but only in a related patent~\citep{mohamed2017neural},
it appears the synthesizer was trained using the \emph{Adam} optimizer~\citep{kingma2014adam}.
We follow this example,
using the standard parameter values $\beta_1=0.9, \beta_2=0.999$ as suggested in \citet{kingma2014adam}.

As in the original paper,
our evaluation on the test set involves sampling the synthesizer for 100 programs (which may include duplicates),
and considering the trial a success if any of these demonstrates the desired program behavior.
A more sophisticated alternative here might be to use a controller such as \emph{beam search}~\citep{polosukhin2018neural}
as we have discussed in the context of \emph{neural-guided deductive search}~\citep{deepcoder} in section \ref{sec:ngs}.

As explained in section \ref{sec:datagen},
during generation we had discarded any programs not passing some basic \emph{sanity checks},
of what we expect to be reasonable traits for programs in a synthesis setting.
Following this example, during evaluation we similarly disregard any such programs not deemed 'sane' by this standard.

For the purpose of calculating total loss for an epoch,
we presently aggregate the loss over the different
task functions in our training set by taking their mean.
Such losses for a task function in turn had separately aggregated
over any holes encountered across the different synthesis steps,
i.e. potentially covering a hole multiple times if it initially remains unfilled,
and as such is encountered across various partial programs along the way.

Again, this was a design decision we have not empirically research,
and may be a relevant topic for future research.
Alternate loss aggregations here would be to either
skip the intermediate loss aggregation for a separate task function,
or, instead e.g. consider reweighing losses for different holes,
to compensate for certain holes, particularly those close to the AST root,
ending up over-represented as a result of their multiple occurrences,
as we will further discuss in section \ref{sec:picking}.

\paragraph{Picking holes} \label{sec:picking}

We have not empirically verified our decision to pick a hole to fill during training using a \emph{uniform random} distribution,
and one might well compare this to synthesizer performance when e.g. deterministically picking a hole to fill.

While we believe such uniform sampling beats deterministic hole picking to more uniformly explore our potential program space during training,
there is arguably still room for improvement here over uniform sampling.

While sophisticated learning algorithms may use \emph{weighted sampling}~\citep{chen1994weighted}
methods in order to place more emphasis on e.g. parts of our program space that our learner is not performing well on yet,
our current paper will settle for a naive approximation of uniform exploration of our \emph{search space}.

The key here to note is that uniform sampling of \emph{holes} is not necessarily equivalent to uniformly exploring our \emph{search space}.
This goes even for the sequence-based example, where such hole picking does not apply:
in order to explore sequences 'aa' and 'ab',
a sequential approach while \emph{necessarily} go through just 'a' in both cases.

As a result, such intermediate smaller programs are sampled more than their larger 'child' programs \emph{by definition}.
Weighted sampling may help to alleviate this.
However, in our AST-based synthesis scenario,
the hole picking gives this problem an extra dimension,
causing this decrepancy between uniform hole sampling and uniform exploration of our search space.

Let us illustrate this with a lambda calculus task function \verb|(a (b c))|.%
~\footnote{
    While for the purpose of this illustration we will stick to lambda calculus
    rather than our \emph{unrolled} version thereof,
    this does not actually affect the example.
    The only difference would be we may substitute $(\_\quad\_)$ with e.g. $(f\quad\_\quad\_)$.
}
Starting from our base program of just a hole, \verb|_|,
our only initial expansion is to \verb|(_ _)|.
Our second expansion toward \verb|(a (b c))| however,
can go two ways: either \verb|(a _)| or \verb|(_ (_ _))|.
Now, while \verb|(a _)| could only expand into \verb|(a (_ _))|,
\verb|(_ (_ _))| could go to either that same \verb|(a (_ _))|,
\verb|(_ (b _))|, or \verb|(_ (_ c))|.

As such, uniform sampling does not lead to uniform exploration:
our nodes near to the root, in this program filled with $a$,
on the basis of going through more synthesis rounds,
is explored more easily than our leaves further away from the root,
in our program eventually filled with $b$ and $c$, respectively.

Therefore, it would be more ideal for a hole sampling method to inhibit
bias toward the more \emph{deeply-situated} holes in our program,
such as to offset this inherent imbalance and better approximate
uniform exploration of our program search space.

Techniques such as active learning or Bayesian optimization may be able to find optimal sampling strategies for this purpose.
However, one relevant question here is whether these techniques under all circumstances justify the extra calculation power to improve this decision-making,
and whether there would be any reasonable compromises available.
These questions are still subject to future research.

% \subsubsection{Changes}

\subsubsection{Functional program domain} \label{sec:fp}

Aside from the grammar we have described in section \ref{sec:unroll},
translating \citet{nsps}'s synthesizer from its original \emph{FlashFill}~\citep{prose} domain to our domain of \emph{functional programs},
we have had to make the following adjustments to their original algorithm:

% \begin{itemize}
    % \item
    While the input-output samples used by \citet{nsps} were all \emph{strings},
    in our functional domain these could essentially comprise arbitrary \emph{expressions}.
    While ideally a synthesizer would respect the tree-like structure of such expressions as ASTs,
    our naive approach has been to simply perform \emph{sample serialization} here,
    taking string versions of our actual input/output expressions,
    then \emph{one-hot encode} these as \citet{nsps} did using \emph{their} string samples.

    % \item
    In our functional setup,
    we distinguished potentially multiple \emph{type instantiations} for each function,
    which may depend on its type signature's number of \emph{type variables},
    as well as on any potential \emph{type constraints} on these type variables.

    As we attempt to generate a similar number of input/output samples for each such type instantiation,
    this means we do not have similar upper bounds for the total number of input/output samples for functions with \emph{different} number of type instantiations.

    While this does not pose a problem for our sample \emph{encoder},
    it did actually end up problematic for the purpose of \citet{nsps}'s \emph{R3NN},
    which \emph{conditioned} programs on these sample features using an LSTM,
    which expected a \emph{fixed} number of embedded samples.

    To work around this and provide such a fixed number number of samples despite differing number of type instantiations,
    we perform \emph{feature sampling}.
    For this end we have chosen to sample \emph{with replacement},
    which both exhibits a more consistent behavior across sample sizes,
    while also seeming to match the spirit of mini-batching,
    by providing more stochastic gradients.
    However, this decision is still up for empirical evaluation.

    It should be noted that this sampling,
    while intended to normalize sample size stemming from different numbers of type instantiations,
    it simultaneously addresses different sample sizes \emph{within} type instantiations.
    Under normal circumstances, the \emph{boolean} type, for example,
    could not have generated more examples than merely \emph{false} and \emph{true}.
    By using sampling, this sample set could be normalized to a fixed size as well.

    Moreover, while fixing such a sample size satisfies the constraints of our LSTM used in sample conditioning,
    this is essentially an unfortunate compromise;
    if a function is significantly more general in its function,
    allowing for a wider variety of input types,
    then being forced to pick a fixed sample size means simpler programs with few types may potentially be learned more easily than programs with e.g. a greater number of type instances.
    It would likely be preferable to offset this sample size fixing by e.g. giving more weight to hard programs (or samples, for that matter).
    
% \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Optimizations}

We have further made the following optimizations on top of \citet{nsps}'s approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item While \citet{nsps} did not expand on this,
    for the \emph{one-hot encoding} process in their encoder,
    we initially included any characters in the ASCII character set,
    which seemed to cover any character conceivably used in our serialization of input/output samples (or their types, for that matter).
    However, as we realized this potentially gave our encoder an encoding space larger than necessary,
    we instead started to track for our datasets which characters they would \emph{actually require} for serialization,
    such that we could limit our one-hot encodings to the smallest space possible.
    \item While \citet{nsps}'s \emph{R3NN} ends using a \emph{softmax} operation,
    calculating the actual estimated probability of any potential hole expansion,
    we \emph{delay} this until our \emph{cross-entropy} loss calculation to combine these for the purpose of the \emph{log-sum-exp} trick~\citep{eisele2016log},
    aiding numerical stability.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design limitations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Our implementation settled for \citet{nsps}'s \emph{baseline LSTM encoder} rather than its fancier \emph{cross-correlation} encoder variants.
    While such variants may improve synthesis quality,
    these come at an increased amount of \emph{computation} as well.
    \item Also of note is that our present implementation has yet to be optimized for run-time performance:
    our model can presently be run on CPU,
    and has yet to implement batching over task functions in the R3NN,
    an implementation detail that had not been given any attention in \citet{nsps}.
    \item While \citet{nsps} used a limit of 13 operations for their synthesized programs,
    we are able to apply such a limit during task function generation as well.
    For the sake of simplicity, we have opted to share this limit,
    specified during dataset generation,
    with our synthesizer as well.
    This presently disregards any synthesized programs of
    correct behavior but exceeding our complexity limit.
    While the primary intention here is to prevent synthesis
    from diverging into ever-expanding programs,
    one might imagine a better compromise here instead.
    This limit affects evaluation,
    but the limit has no effect on learning during training.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Types} \label{sec:typednsps}

% why types? differences from NLP, CS way, not reflected in ASTs in e.g. variables
% how to supervise with these? representation?

To get the most out of our types, we will want to provide them for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item inputs and outputs%
    ~\footnote{
        These may span multiple types for any given task function exhibiting \emph{parametric polymorphism}.
    },
    which we may just incorporate as additional features in \citet{nsps}'s \emph{example encoder};
    \item expansion rule expressions, for which we may calculate types statically upfront, then embed
    % separate from our other inputs
    in the initialization of \citet{nsps}'s \emph{R3NN};%
    ~\footnote{
        If we are using an unrolled grammar,
        then would like to take its type presuming all holes contained in the expansion rule expression have already been filled.
        At this moment, this is not yet the case,
        meaning we have will not yet have received additional type constraints that may yet manifest further down the road.
        If we use the original grammar,
        closer to that of the lambda calculus itself,
        we are unfortunately unable to obtain any type for the function application expansion rule,
        which could itself end up returning any potential type.
    }
    % \item holes to be filled by synthesis;%
    \item abstract syntax tree (AST) nodes, spanning both leaf nodes (variables or holes%
    ~\footnote{
        In the event of a function application node where both sub-nodes are still holes,
        for its argument sub-node we will not yet have any type available.
        For its function sub-node, we will have a return type available,
        based on the type asked by its parent node,
        although our argument type will still be unknown.
    }
    ) and branch nodes (in our domain so far all indicating function application); these may be based on the above-mentioned expansion rule types, although the branch nodes should be handled as in \citet{nsps}'s \emph{R3NN}.
\end{itemize}

The basic idea here is simple: our program should return the desired type, while taking the desired input types.
Using this information should improve our search,
as per our research hypothesis \#1.
% \ref{hyp:types}.

\paragraph{Type filter} \label{sec:filter}

However, in the simple case, the implications of this info do not require much computation:
one will just restrict their search to those AST nodes allowed for the present hole as dictated by the grammar,
as per our research hypothesis \#2.
% \ref{hyp:filter}
We achieve this by simply masking the predicted scores of uncompiling programs
(before calculating actual probabilities by softmax) to have any probability, i.e. $p=0.0$.

\section{Experiment} \label{sec:experiment}

To perform our experiment, we will first perform \emph{hyperparameter optimization} on our vanilla implementation of \emph{neuro-symbolic program synthesis},
as we will describe in section \ref{sec:hparopt},
then use these hyperparameters to evaluate three different models;
this vanilla implementation, our type-based additions described in \ref{sec:typednsps},
as well as the filter-based approach described in \ref{sec:filter}.

We went through the literature to find a suitable benchmark task and correspond training dataset.

On the one hand, benchmark tasks within \emph{neural} program synthesis have often remained somewhat simpler in nature,
rendering them less fit for our purposes ---
either being imperative in nature (and as such being less amenable to types),
such as sorting tasks~\citep{npi,alphanpi},
otherwise focusing on a simple set of types --- such as strings~\citep{nsps} ---%
or differently put, not including operators with parametric return types.

Furthermore, it was also common for such existing papers to keep their datasets unpublished~\citep{nsps,deepcoder},
meaning we would not be able to train and evaluate on the same data,
preventing a fair comparison by using the same dataset.

On the other hand, especially benchmark tasks within \emph{non-neural} program synthesis methods have usually consisted of only a limited number of tasks%
~\citep{myth,lambda2,typedmil,houdini,tamandu,dilp,terpret},
since such non-neural methods do not require an equivalent to the training set typically used in machine learning setups.

This means that, while we would be able to use such a benchmark task as our \emph{test set} for the purpose of comparison,
we would need to ourselves generate a corresponding \emph{training set}, and for the purpose of hyperparameter optimization, also a \emph{validation set}.

% we may simply ensure our test sets contain the benchmark tasks of existing papers.
% To achieve this, we may increasingly add types, such as to support, in order of complexity:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item list, bool~\citep{terpret}
%     \item int~\citep{tamandu}
%     \item char~\citep{typedmil}
%     \item nat, tree~\citep{myth,lambda2}
% \end{itemize}

% Now, while it seemed preferable to hook into existing operator sets to benchmark against other algorithms than \citet{nsps},
% it turned out tough to find potential comparisons there that would have a level playing field;
% while neural methods typically used synthesis domains outside of functional programs,
% or did not publish their datasets,
% non-neural methods did not need to deal with the engineering challenges of a neural synthesizer.

% As such, while comparing neural to non-neural methods is a topic of interest,
% given the present state of datasets and neural methods in the field of functional program synthesis,
% it is not the primary focus of this paper.

Now, in order to create a \emph{level playing field},
our evaluation task must match the limitations of our own DSL and implementation.
The challenge here is that non-neural methods typically do not need to deal with the engineering challenges of a neural synthesizer,
for our purposes making it challenging to keep up with such methods in terms of synthesizer feature set.
Such non-neural methods considered as potential benchmarks often featured more comprehensive grammars,
typically incorporating function recursion~\citep{typedmil,myth},
if not also pattern matching and a flexible set of primitive operators and constants~\citep{lambda2},
while our synthesizer has focused on keeping to a minimal feature set required to investigate our hypotheses.

As such, to constrain the engineering scope of our experiment,
it would seem desirable to use a benchmark paper similarly limited in grammar,
so as to reduce complexity not required for the experiment where possible.
By this reasoning, we would like to benchmark against \citet{tamandu}, which
    "[focuses] on the synthesis of purely functional programs without any lambda expressions,
    explicit recursion or conditionals (i.e., only function application is allowed)".
We will do this by taking libraries of basic operations in accordance with this paper,
then, in order to create training and validation sets,
sample functions from the program space combining these operators,
within a given complexity threshold.

\citet{tamandu} reports using the following 37 operators or \emph{library components} for synthesis, many of which directly corresponding to Haskell's built-in \emph{Prelude} functions:
\begin{description}
    \item[general functions] \texttt{const, flip}
    \item[booleans] \texttt{true, false, not}
    \item[integer constructors] \texttt{zero, succ}
    \item[integer destructors] \texttt{isZero}
    \item[integer combinators] \texttt{foldNat, foldNatNat}
    \item[arithmetics] \texttt{add, mul, div, max, eq, neq}
    \item[list constructors] \texttt{nil, con}
    \item[list destructors] \texttt{head, tail, isNil}
    \item[list combinators] \texttt{map, foldr, foldl, filter}
    \item[list functions] \texttt{length, append, reverse, replicate, concat}
    \item[list of integers functions] \texttt{sum, prod, maximum, member, enumTo, enumFromTo}
\end{description}

Their task functions are as follows: 
\texttt{drop, droplast, dropmax, factorial, isEven, last, mapAdd, mapDouble, multfirst, multlast, nth, stutter, append, concat, enumFromTo, enumTo, isNil, length, maximum, member, replicate, reverse, sum}

We have based our reimplementation of their operators and task functions on their source repository~\citep{tamandurepo}.

\subsubsection{Hyperparameters used for dataset generation}

The hyperparameters we have used in our dataset generation have been as follows:
\begin{description}

    % figure out a sensible split. NSPS mentions training/test tho not validation.
    % We sample a subset of only 1000 training programs from the 5 million program set to report the training results in the tables. The test sets also consist of 1000 programs.
    \item[splits] train (0.35) / validation (0.35) / test (0.3)

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Hyperparameters optimized in a search} \label{sec:hparopt}

Hyperparameters we \emph{search} over, rather than fixed up-front,
% TODO: actually adjust hyperparameters to match this reasoning
% have been picked based on the question of whether we expected them to have a 'sweet spot' in terms of optimum value,
% rather than being an obvious case of 'higher is better';
% these include
include
dropout rate~\citep{baldi2014dropout},
% L2 regularization rate~\citep{zhang2018three},
the number of features \emph{M} used in our symbol and expansion rule embeddings as per \citet{nsps}'s \emph{R3NN},
the number of features \emph{H} used per input or output per LSTM direction as per \citet{nsps}'s \emph{baseline LSTM encoder},
the number of hidden units for the first and second hidden layers (presently fixed to 2 hidden layers) used in the \emph{recursive} and \emph{reverse-recursive} passes of \citet{nsps}'s \emph{R3NN}.

This search is performed by a genetic algorithm~\citep{koza1994genetic},
used a 20\% \emph{mutation} rate,
an 80\% \emph{cross-over} rate,
a \emph{population} size fixed to the square root of the total number of hyper-parameter configurations (rounded up),
and the \emph{4th root} of the total number of hyper-parameter configurations (again rounded up)
used as the maximum number of \emph{generations} and as the number of \emph{best entities} to keep track of.

\section{Result} % \label{sec:result}

Having added our type-level supervision during training, we expect synthesis success rates to rise and required evaluations to drop compared to the baseline algorithm.
This demonstrates that the findings from traditional program synthesis methods are relevant also in the field of neural program synthesis.

\subsection{Topics for future research}

As neural synthesis methods aimed at programming by example in the functional
programming domain is a broad topic encompassing a variety of design decisions,
we have had to leave quite some questions unanswered.
We will here give an overview of the questions raised during our design process specifically:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How can we apply a more generalized program synthesis model to a specific problem?
    Can we take inspiration here from neural network pruning?
    \item While we have focused on types as features and compilation for masking purposes here,
    after each synthesis step,
    in languages featuring typed holes we may \emph{pre-compile} even partial programs such as to provide the synthesizer with immediate feedback;
    as with types, we similarly hypothesize neural program synthesis methods can benefit from using compilation checks as additional features.
    However, this would require a \emph{weakly supervised} neural synthesizer,
    i.e. using \emph{reinforcement learning},
    whereas our present synthesizer is based on the simpler \emph{strongly supervised} setup.
    As such, this was unfortunately out of scope for our current paper.
    \item Lastly, we hypothesize that these added features still offer added value over
    deduction-based approaches aiming to push input-output examples through the grammar
    (investigate separately for datasets without and with many functions that are not invertible)
    and using type-based filters.
    This question, again, unfortunately required an architecture significantly different from our own.
    \item While we have looked into the added value of types as features,
    this gives rise to an additional question:
    what operator features are most conducive to benefiting from type info?
    While we have briefly conjectured this to involve having few yet generically applicable operators,
    this question has fallen out of scope for our paper,
    and remains a question for future research.
    \item While we have investigated the use of type info in neural programming by example,
    one could allocate such extra compute to just the existing information as well.
    This implies there may be an ideal split between features allocated to expressions versus types.
    Investigating this ideal split would be a topic for future research.
    \item While we have presently let our synthesizer pick a hole using a \emph{uniform random} distribution,
    as we have discussed in section \ref{sec:picking},
    this approach is still subject to further research.
    For one, the use of this approach could be empirically tested by deterministically picking a hole to verify the added value of uniform hole sampling.
    As discussed, we believe there to be hole picking strategies better approximating uniform search space exploration than uniform hole sampling as well.
    \item In section \ref{sec:ournsps}, we have discussed our aggregation of
    the loss function over the different task functions in the training set.
    We had not empirically verified our present configuration on this,
    and offered different alternatives there.
    These too would merit further research.
    \item We briefly discussed dynamic sample sizes,
    how our sample-conditioning LSTM expected a fixed sample size,
    how we worked around this using \emph{sampling with replacement},
    and how this was an unfortunate compromise that failed to assign more complex functions,
    supporting multiple type instantiations,
    the additional attention they would intuitively require in order to properly learn their behavior.
    This would likely require \emph{weighted sampling} of task functions (if not samples as well),
    and this too remains a topic of interest for future research.
    \item As we touched upon in section \ref{sec:unroll},
    the merits of our \emph{unrolled grammar} approach are still up for empirical evaluation.
    As our present dataset allowed us to settle for this approach,
    we decided to regard this question as out of scope for our present paper.
    \item In section \ref{sec:fp} we briefly discussed our decision to use
    \emph{sampling with replacement} as a strategy to ensure we could fix
    the number of embedded samples used when conditioning our programs
    with input/output samples.
    However, we have not yet empirically evaluated the relative merits of
    sampling with versus without for this purpose,
    and this too would be a question of interest for future research.
